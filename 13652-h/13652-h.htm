<p>Dr. Dodds' <i>Exposition of the Apostles' Creed</i> will
supply a real need. It contains a careful, well-informed, and
well-balanced statement of the doctrines of the Church which are
expressed or indicated in the Creed, and it will be helpful to
many as arranging the passages of Scripture on which these
doctrines rest. Though historical references could have been
easily made, the Editors agree with the author in thinking that
to insert them in the discussion of doctrines would have probably
perplexed the readers for whom the book is designed.</p>

<p>The title and purpose of this Handbook limit its subject
matter to an exposition of the doctrines which have place in the
summary of belief termed the Apostles' Creed. It is not meant to
cover the whole field of Christian doctrine.</p>
<p>A history of the Creed has not been attempted. There is much
that is interesting in its origin and growth. It did not come
into existence all at once, but was built up from time to time by
the insertion of clauses formulated by Councils or by leading
representatives of the Christian Church. The space available is
not sufficient to include a history.</p>
<p>The Handbook being not controversial but expository,
references to the heretics and heresies that gave occasion for
the articles which have place in the Creed are few and brief.</p>

<p>While the disciples had Jesus with them, there was no occasion
for a formal summary of the doctrines which His followers were
called to accept and to maintain. He was present to resolve all
doubts and settle all difficulties, so that when their faith was
assailed or their teaching impugned they could refer to Him.
Then, as now, faith had Him for its object,&mdash;with this
difference, that He was visibly at hand to counsel and to direct,
while now He is passed into the heavens and guides His people
into all truth, not by personal instruction but by His invisible
though ever present Spirit.</p>
<p>Another reason why Jesus gave His disciples no creed may be
found in the fact that His work was not finished until He had
laid down His life, and that no creed could have been
satisfactory which did not cover those great unfulfilled events
in His history that lie at the foundation of the Christian
religion.</p>
<p>Jesus did indeed require belief in Himself as a condition on
which healing and salvation were bestowed. Unbelief hindered His
work, while faith in His Messianic claims and mission never
failed to secure a rich blessing to those who confessed Him. The
faith which He recognised was not the acceptance and confession
of a summary of doctrine such as any of the Creeds now existing,
but a simple statement of belief in Himself as the Son of God and
the Messiah. On one occasion only does He appear to have called
for a confession which went further than this, when, having
declared to Martha the great doctrine of Resurrection, He put to
her the question, "Believest thou this?"<a name=
"FNanchor001"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_001"><sup>[001]</sup></a></p>
<p>After His death and resurrection, when Jesus charged His
disciples to preach the Gospel, He bade them teach their
followers to observe all things whatsoever He had commanded
them.<a name="FNanchor002"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_002"><sup>[002]</sup></a> The Apostles, accordingly,
appear to have furnished the leaders of the churches they planted
with summaries of doctrine, such as we find in the fifteenth
chapter of Paul's first Epistle to the Corinthians.<a name=
"FNanchor003"></a><a href="#Footnote_003"><sup>[003]</sup></a>
Paul seems to refer to such a summary when he writes to the
Romans commending them for obedience to the "form of doctrine"
which was delivered them,<a name="FNanchor004"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_004"><sup>[004]</sup></a> and when he bestows his
benediction on those Galatians who walked according to "this
rule."<a name="FNanchor005"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_005"><sup>[005]</sup></a> It was, doubtless, such a
compendium of doctrine he had in view when he charged Timothy to
"keep that which was committed to his trust," contrasting this
"deposit" with "profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of
science falsely so called."<a name="FNanchor006"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_006"><sup>[006]</sup></a> The bearing of this charge
is made more emphatic when it is repeated by the Apostle in
connection with the exhortation, "Hold fast the form of sound
words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in
Christ Jesus."<a name="FNanchor007"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_007"><sup>[007]</sup></a></p>
<p>It would thus appear that from Apostolic times there existed a
form of words of the character of a creed, which, for some
reason, came to be jealously guarded and concealed from all who
were not Christians. It was perhaps Paul's reference to the
summary of doctrine as a "deposit" to be carefully kept, that led
the early converts to regard it as a private possession&mdash;a
trust to be hidden in the heart and covered from unfriendly eyes.
The Apostle did not mean that it should be so regarded, but this
interpretation given to his words, or some other cause, led to
its being used as a watchword rather than as an open confession,
the consequence of which is that in the writings of the earliest
Christian fathers no statement of doctrines corresponding to a
creed is found.</p>
<p>The absence of creeds or of allusions to them in the oldest
Christian treatises gives seeming point to the objection urged by
Professor Harnack and others against the Apostles' Creed as now
held and interpreted by the Church, that it is not a correct
summary of early Christian belief. That such objections are not
well founded will become apparent as the various articles of the
Creed are considered in the light of Apostolic teaching. The
absence of creeds in early Christian writings is sufficiently
accounted for by the care with which the summary was cherished as
a secret trust, to be treasured in the memory but not to be
written or otherwise profaned by publicity.</p>
<p>The word "creed"&mdash;derived from the Latin "<i>credo</i>, I
believe"&mdash;is, in its ecclesiastical sense, used to denote a
summary or concise statement of doctrines formulated and accepted
by a church. Although usually connected with religious belief, it
has a wider meaning, and designates the principles which an
individual or an associated body so holds that they become the
springs and guides of conduct. Some sects of Christians reject
formal creeds and profess to find the Scriptures sufficient for
all purposes that creeds are meant to serve. The Christian
religion rests on Christ, and the final appeal on any question of
doctrine must be to the Scriptures which testify of Him: but it
is found that very different conclusions are often reached by
those who profess to ground their beliefs upon the same passages
of the Word of God. Almost every heresy that has disturbed the
unity of the Church has been advocated by men who appealed to
Scripture in confirmation of the doctrines they taught. The true
teaching of the Word of God is gathered from careful and
continuous searching of the Scriptures, and there is danger of
fatal error when conclusions are drawn from isolated passages
interpreted in accordance with preconceived opinions. It has been
found not only expedient but needful that the Christian Churches
should set forth in creeds and confessions the doctrines which
they believe the Scriptures affirm. They are bound not only to
accept Scripture as the rule of faith, but to make known the
sense in which they understand it. As unlearned and unstable men
wrest and subvert the Sacred Writings, it is fitting that those
who are learned and not unstable should publish sound expositions
of their contents. In the light of creeds, converts are enabled
to test their own position, and to put to proof the claims of
those who profess to be teachers of Christian doctrine.</p>
<p>One of the most widely accepted of these forms is the
Apostles' Creed, so called, not because it was drawn up by, or in
the time of, the Apostles&mdash;although there is a tradition to
the effect that each of them contributed a clause&mdash;but
because it is in accordance with the sum of Apostolic teaching.
The history of this Creed is not easily traced. The care with
which it was guarded excluded it from the writings of the early
fathers, and it is impossible, therefore, to assign to their
proper dates, with certainty, some of the articles of which it is
composed. This, however, is evident, that it came gradually into
existence, clauses being added from time to time to guard the
faithful against false doctrine, or to enable them to defend the
orthodox belief. It appears to have been the general creed of the
Christian Church, in a form very similar to that which it now
bears, from the close of the second century.<a name=
"FNanchor008"></a><a href="#Footnote_008"><sup>[008]</sup></a> At
that time and afterwards it served not only as a test of
Christian doctrine, but was also used by catechists in training
and instructing candidates for admission to the Church.</p>
<p>It is sometimes urged as an objection to this Creed that it is
not a sufficiently comprehensive summary of Christian doctrine.
Those who object to it on this ground should consider the purpose
of creeds. They were not meant to cover the whole field of
Christian faith, but to fortify believers against the teaching of
heretics. The Apostles' Creed was not intended, and does not
profess, to state all the things that Christians ought to
believe. There is no reference in it to Scripture, to
Inspiration, to Prayer, or to the Sacraments. It sets forth in a
few words, distinct and easily remembered, the existence and
relations to men of the three Persons of the Godhead&mdash;those
facts and truths on which all doctrine and duty rest, and from
which they find development.</p>
<p>It is especially objected that there is no reference in this
Creed to the atoning work of the Lord Jesus Christ. But, though
not directly expressed, this doctrine is really and substantially
contained in it. The Creed is the confession of those whose bond
of union is common faith in the Lord Jesus Christ as their
Saviour. The articles which treat of Him and of His sufferings
and work are intelligible only to those who believe in the
reality and efficacy of the Atonement.</p>
<p>The Creed contains twelve articles, and to each of these, and
to every part of it, the words "I believe" belong. One article
relates to God the Father, six to God the Son, one to God the
Holy Ghost, and four to the Holy Catholic Church and the
privileges secured to its members. These articles are&mdash;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em;">1. I believe in God the Father
Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth.<br>
<br>
 2. And in Jesus Christ His only Son our Lord,<br>
<br>
 3. Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin
Mary,<br>
<br>
 4. Suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and
buried,<br>
<br>
 5. He descended into hell; the third day He rose again from the
dead,<br>
<br>
 6. He ascended into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of God
the Father Almighty;<br>
<br>
 7. From thence He shall come to judge the quick and the dead.<br>
<br>
 8. I believe in the Holy Ghost,<br>
<br>
 9. The Holy Catholic Church; the Communion of saints;<br>
<br>
 10. The Forgiveness of sins;<br>
<br>
 11. The Resurrection of the body,<br>
<br>
 12. And the Life Everlasting.</div>
<p>In estimating the value of creeds in the early ages of the
Christian Church, it is important to bear in mind that the
converts were almost wholly dependent on oral instruction for
their knowledge of Divine truth. Copies of the Old and New
Testaments existed in manuscript only. These were few in number,
and the cost of production placed them beyond the reach of the
great majority. A single copy served for a community or a
district in which the Hebrew or the Greek tongue was understood,
but in localities where other languages were in use the living
voice was needed to make revelation known. It is only since the
invention of printing and the application of the steam-engine to
the economical and rapid production of books, and since modern
linguists have multiplied the translations of the Bible, that it
has become in their own tongues accessible to believers in all
lands, available for private perusal and family reading. It was
therefore a necessity that Christians should possess "a form of
sound words," comprehensive enough to embody the leading
doctrines of Christianity, yet brief enough to be easily
committed to memory.</p>

<p><i>1. I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven
and earth</i></p>
<p>SECTION 1.&mdash;I BELIEVE</p>
<br>

<p>The Creed is the expression of personal belief. Whether spoken
in private or in a public assembly, it is the confession of the
faith held by each individual for himself. Each of us has a
separate life, and each of us must personally accept God's
message and express his own belief. Religion must influence men
as units before it can benefit them in masses. Faith that saves
is a gift of God which every one must receive for himself. The
faith of one is of no avail for another, therefore the Creed
begins with the affirmation "<i>I</i> believe." In repeating it
we profess our own faith in what God has revealed concerning
Himself.</p>
<p>"I <i>believe</i>."&mdash;The Apostles' Creed is a declaration
of things which are most surely believed among us, and its
several parts or articles are founded upon the contents of
Scripture, which is our one rule of faith. It does not begin with
the words <i>I think</i> or <i>I know</i>, but with the statement
"I believe." "Belief" is used in various senses, but here it
means the assent of the mind and heart to the doctrines expressed
in the Creed. When we repeat the form we declare that we accept
and adopt all the statements which it covers. "With the heart man
believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is
made."<a name="FNanchor009"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_009"><sup>[009]</sup></a></p>
<p>Faith differs from knowledge. There are some things which we
know to be true, and there are others of which we say we believe
them to be true. There are certain truths which are termed
axiomatic. When the terms in which they are expressed are
understood, the truth they convey is at once admitted. We know
that two and two make four, we know that two straight lines
cannot enclose a space; but we do not know in the same sense
those things which the Creed affirms. It deals with statements
that, for the most part, have never been, and cannot be, tested
by sense, and that cannot be demonstrated by such proof as will
compel us to accept them. We believe them, not because it is
impossible to withhold our assent, nor only because nature,
history, and conscience confirm them, but on the ground of
testimony. "Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of
God."<a name="FNanchor010"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_010"><sup>[010]</sup></a> We believe because we are
assured on sufficient and competent authority that these things
are so. We know that we live in a material universe, but our
knowledge does not extend to the manner in which the universe
came into being. That is a matter of belief. "Through
faith"&mdash;not by ocular or logical proof, but on
testimony&mdash;"we understand that the worlds were framed by the
Word of God."<a name="FNanchor011"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_011"><sup>[011]</sup></a></p>
<p>Faith differs from opinion. When a man believes his mind is
made up. By whatever process it may have been reached, the
conclusion commends itself as one that is fixed and irreversible.
Opinion, on the other hand, is held loosely. It is based not on
certainty but on probability. The possibility of error is
recognised, and the opinion is readily surrendered when the
grounds on which it was formed are seen to be insufficient or
misleading. "A man," says Coleridge, "having seen a million moss
roses all red, concludes from his own experience and that of
others that all moss roses are red. That is a maxim with
him&mdash;the <i>greatest</i> amount of his knowledge upon the
subject. But it is only true until some gardener has produced a
white moss rose,&mdash;after which the maxim is good for
nothing."<a name="FNanchor012"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_012"><sup>[012]</sup></a></p>
<p>The testimony on which faith rests is human or Divine. It is
human in so far as it is based on human experience and
observation. It is Divine in so far as it rests upon the direct
revelation of God. Faith in man is continually exercised in
business and in all the departments of life. It is necessary to
the very existence of society. Faith in God moves in another
sphere. Its objects are not seen or temporal, and they do not
rest for proof upon the testimony of man. It receives and assents
to statements which are made on the authority of God, who knows
all things, who therefore cannot be deceived, and who is truth
and therefore cannot deceive us. On this Divine rock of faith,
and not upon her own knowledge, the Christian Church rests. "If
we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater."<a
name="FNanchor013"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_013"><sup>[013]</sup></a> Among Christian virtues
faith stands first. It must precede everything else. It is the
foundation on which all Christian character and life are built.
"He that cometh unto God must believe that he is."<a name=
"FNanchor014"></a><a href="#Footnote_014"><sup>[014]</sup></a>
"Without faith it is impossible to please God."<a name=
"FNanchor015"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_015"><sup>[015]</sup></a></p>
<p>That which Christian faith realises and grasps is expressed in
doctrine. Faith is not a separate and self-dependent grace. Its
existence and growth arise from those things which are believed,
and therefore it is necessary to study and understand, as far as
we can, the doctrines of the Christian faith before we can
possess or manifest belief. It is important that we should have a
definite knowledge of these doctrines; that we should study them
in relation to the Scriptures upon which they profess to be
founded, and that we should be in a position to defend them
against assailants. Thus faith will gather strength, and
believers will be "ready always to give an answer to every man
that asketh them a reason of the hope that is in them with
meekness and fear."<a name="FNanchor016"></a><a href=

"#Footnote_017"><sup>[017]</sup></a></p>
<p>The existence of God is the basis of all religious belief. If
there is no God, there is no moral obligation. If there is no
Almighty Being to whom men owe existence, and to whom they must
give account, worship is a vain show and systems of religion are
meaningless. Theologians, therefore, from the days of the first
Christian apologists to our own time, have endeavoured to
establish by proof the doctrine of the Divine existence. To those
who accept the authority of Scripture the existence of God is a
fact which no argument can overthrow; but as there are many who
reject this authority, evidence has been sought elsewhere than in
Scripture to establish the doctrine. The arguments for the Being
of God are mainly threefold, being drawn: (<i>a</i>) from the
consciousness of mankind; (<i>b</i>) from the order and design
that are manifest in the universe; and (<i>c</i>) from the
written revelation which claims to have come to men from God
Himself.</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) (<i>Consciousness</i>) There is a wonderful agreement
among men as to the existence of a great invisible Being by whom
the world was created and is governed, and who charges Himself
with the control and guidance of its inhabitants and concerns. In
a land such as our own, in which Christianity has held place for
many centuries, belief in God, however it may fail to produce
holy living, is almost universal. This belief exercises a strong
influence, and has contributed not a little to the formation of
our national character. It is an atmosphere always around us,
sustaining and promoting the healthy life of those even who are
the least conscious of being affected by it. The belief is
indelibly impressed upon our laws, our literature, and even our
everyday occupations. It is stamped upon the relations men
sustain to one another. It is this which for one day weekly
suspends labour that Christians may have leisure to worship God
and to meditate upon the duties they owe to Him. It is in
recognition of this that we see tall spires pointing heavenward,
and churches opening their portals to the inhabitants of crowded
cities and to the dwellers in scattered villages. In Christian
lands the consciousness of men bears testimony to the existence
of God, but it is not in such lands only that this consciousness
exists and confirms belief in the Divine. In the earliest times,
long before history began to be written, such a consciousness was
prevalent, leading men to faith in and worship of a Being or
Beings infinitely greater than themselves, present with them and
presiding, though invisibly, over their destinies. The study of
Comparative Religion has shown how nearly the primeval
inhabitants of lands widely distant from each other were at one
in the views they had come to entertain. Hymns, prayers,
precepts, and traditions are found in the sacred books of the
great religions of the East, and archaeologists have deciphered
on ancient monuments, and traced in primitive religious rites,
clear evidence of belief in the existence of the Divine. The
valleys of the Nile, of the Euphrates, and of the Tigris have
revealed facts for the theologian's benefit that are almost
exhaustless. In the Egyptian Book of the Dead, and in the
religious hymns and the ritual of which they formed part in the
sacred literature of Babylonia, there is proof that four thousand
years ago hymns were sung in honour of the gods, and prayers were
offered to propitiate them and secure their favour. But belief in
God had place long before these hymns were sung or these prayers
offered. This is shown by the existence of words in the most
ancient hymns, prayers, and inscriptions which could not have
been used unless the ideas which they conveyed had already
existed in men's minds. These words&mdash;some of which are
preserved in modern tongues&mdash;when traced to their roots,
help greatly to explain the character of early religious thought,
and prove the existence of a widely diffused belief in the Divine
Being and His government. They serve as confirmation of a belief,
which is in harmony with many facts, that God had revealed
Himself to humanity before He furnished the revelation which has
come down to us. Words are not originated by accident. They are
expressions of real existences, and before they found place in
hymns or prayers the ideas which they denoted must have been
matters of faith or knowledge to those who used them. Before man
is found professing faith in pagan deities some idea of God must
have existed in his mind. Men did not like to retain God in their
knowledge, and so the idea of the Divine became perverted, and in
its first simplicity was lost, and the multitude followed
numberless shadows all illusory and vain. Still, there lingered
remnants and traditions of belief in a Divine Creator and
Governor which must have originated in such a primeval revelation
as the book of Genesis records. We find there the statement that
God revealed Himself to our first parents by direct intercourse.
They heard and saw and talked with God. They therefore knew of
the existence of God by personal perception, and the ideas they
held regarding Him were founded on His own manifestation of
Himself.</p>
<p>Closely connected with this consciousness is the sense of
responsibility universally prevalent. There is a law written on
the heart of every rational human being, under the guidance of
which he recognises a distinction between good and evil, right
and wrong. He possesses a faculty to which the name of conscience
has been given, that convicts him of sin when he violates, and
approves his conduct when he conforms to, its dictates. However
much different peoples and different ages may be at variance in
their particular ideas of what is right and what is wrong, the
conception itself has place in all of them. There are certain
fundamental notions as to what is just and what is unjust, what
is virtuous and what is vicious, that find universal or all but
universal acceptance. This power of distinguishing between right
and wrong constitutes man a moral being, and separates him by
infinite distance from the lower animals. To the beasts that
perish there is nothing right or wrong. They live altogether
according to nature, and have no responsibility. Man stands in a
different relation to the Lawgiver who bestowed on him the
faculty of conscience and impressed on his soul a conviction that
he will have to give account for all his actions. The Being to
whom he must give account is God.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) (<i>Order</i>) Another ground of this belief is the order
manifest in the universe. There is a symmetry that pervades all
material things of which we have knowledge. Part is adapted to
part; objects are accurately adjusted to each other; "wheels
within wheels" move smoothly; every portion fits into and works
in harmony with every other portion without discord or jarring.
It is unthinkable that these effects should be due to chance or
to a cause that is without intelligence. The perfect arrangement
of parts that work together must have been planned by a living
Being of infinite wisdom, knowledge, and power. This Being, whose
creatures they are, must exist. Behind the pervading order there
must be personality, purpose, and action. The fool may say in his
heart, "There is no God," but, as nature bears testimony to the
existence of an omniscient and omnipotent Creator, reason calls
for another conclusion.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) (<i>Scripture</i>) There is a limit to the knowledge of
God which the consciousness of man and the order and design in
the universe impart. These serve to establish the truth that God
is, but they do not convey the intimation that He is a moral
Governor and the rewarder of them that diligently seek Him. They
declare little of His character, and are silent as to many of the
duties which He requires. To make God known, the teaching of
conscience and of reason must be supplemented by revelation. It
is in the Bible that the believer finds the strongest proofs of
the existence of the Divine Being, and from the Bible he obtains
also the most comprehensive and satisfying view of the Deity and
of man's relation to Him. He there finds that what he has to
believe concerning God is, that He is Jehovah&mdash;the Being
infinitely and eternally perfect, self-existent, and
self-sufficient; the only living and true God, there being none
beside Him. The heathen believed in and worshipped many gods. The
untutored savage peopled the groves with them, and the pagan
philosopher built innumerable temples in their honour. The
Pantheons of Greece and Rome were crowded with the statues of
favourite deities. The doctrine of one living and true God was
prominent in the revelation given to Israel. God's message by
Moses had its foundation&mdash;truth in the proclamation: "Hear,
O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord."<a name=
"FNanchor018"></a><a href="#Footnote_018"><sup>[018]</sup></a>
His glory and His work are shared by no other being. He is the
absolute Sovereign and Lord of all creatures. In the Bible, too,
man learns that God is his own personal God who cares for him,
and to whom he owes love, allegiance, and obedience. All who
refuse to believe in the existence of God reject the testimony of
Scripture regarding Him, but to such as acknowledge its claim to
be the Word of God, the evidence it supplies is convincing and
all-sufficient.</p>
<p>Examination of ancient heathen religions and of the views they
set forth regarding God shows clearly the distance at which they
stand from the revelation of Scripture. The gods of the heathen
were of like passions with their worshippers&mdash;selfish,
cruel, vindictive, and without regard for equity or justice in
their treatment of men. The God of the Bible, on the other hand,
is a righteous God, merciful to His creatures, and desirous of
their temporal and eternal wellbeing, and when He inflicts
suffering it is not as a passionate Judge, but as a Father who
chastens His children for their profit.</p>
<p>The doctrine of the Trinity of Persons in the God-head, though
not expressly stared in the Creed, is implied in the clauses
which refer to each of the Persons who compose it. There is one
God, but in the Godhead there are three Persons, the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Ghost, whose names indicate the relation in
which each stands to the others.</p>
<p>Each of the Persons is complete and perfect God. While there
are three Persons in the Godhead, the same in substance, equal in
power and glory, these three are one. The doctrine thus stated is
termed the doctrine of the Trinity. This word is not found in
Scripture, but the truth which it expresses is set forth there,
dimly in the Old Testament, distinctly in the New. In the first
chapter of Genesis the word "God" is in the Hebrew a plural noun,
and yet it is used with a singular verb, thus early seeming to
intimate what afterwards is clearly made known, that there is a
plurality of Persons, who yet constitute the one living and true
God. The same indication of plurality in unity appears in the
account of man's creation: "Let <i>us</i> make man."<a name=
"FNanchor019"></a><a href="#Footnote_019"><sup>[019]</sup></a>
This doctrine of the Trinity is essentially one of revelation.
Natural religion testifies to the existence, the personality, and
the unity of God, but fails to make known that the unity of God
is a unity of three Persons. The doctrine does not contradict
reason, it is above reason.</p>
<p>It is sometimes said that the doctrine of the Trinity involves
a contradiction in affirming that three Persons are one Person.
This charge misrepresents the doctrine. Trinitarians do not say
that Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are three Persons in the sense
in which three men are three individuals. They believe that there
is one God, and that Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are yet so
distinct that the Father can address the Son, the Son can address
the Father, and the Father can address and send the Spirit. God's
ways are not as our ways. He is not a man that He should be
limited by the conditions of human relationships. When we say
there are three Persons in the Godhead, we use a word applicable
to men, which, though the most fitting one at our disposal, must
come far short of fully describing the relations of Father, Son,
and Holy Ghost to each other. Possessing no celestial language,
we cannot fully describe or understand heavenly things.</p>
<br>

<p>SECTION 3.&mdash;THE FATHER</p>
<br>

<p>The first Person in the Godhead is the Father. This name may
be viewed (<i>a</i>) with reference to the second Person, Jesus
Christ His only Son, or (<i>b</i>) as descriptive of His relation
to believers in Christ Jesus, or (<i>c</i>) as indicating His
universal Fatherhood as the Author and the Preserver of all
intelligent creatures. The relation in which the Father stands to
the Son, that He is His Father and has begotten Him, is one that
we cannot explain. Any attempt to do so must be arrogant and
misleading, for who "by searching can find out God"?<a name=
"FNanchor020"></a><a href="#Footnote_020"><sup>[020]</sup></a>
Secret things belong unto God, but revealed things unto us and
our children.<a name="FNanchor021"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_021"><sup>[021]</sup></a> The term "Father" is a
relative one and involves the idea of sonship. No one who accepts
the teaching of Scripture can doubt that the Father is God. The
statements as to His attributes and universal government are so
many and so strong that, but for other affirmations regarding
Deity, we should naturally conclude that the Father alone is God.
But the very name "Father" corrects such a view, and when we
search the Scriptures we find it untenable. God is our Father,
but He was "the Father" before He called man into being. From all
eternity He was Father. As from everlasting to everlasting He is
God, so from everlasting to everlasting He is Father. He did not
become Father when His Son assumed human nature, but is such in
virtue of His eternal relation to the Word as the Son of God. It
is the Son's existence that constitutes Him Father; and that
existence was in eternity. "I and my Father are one,"<a name=
"FNanchor022"></a><a href="#Footnote_022"><sup>[022]</sup></a> is
the Son's testimony to His eternal Sonship; and when He prays His
Father to glorify Him, He asks to be glorified with the glory
which He had with Him before the world was.<a name=
"FNanchor023"></a><a href="#Footnote_023"><sup>[023]</sup></a>
There are other senses in which the first Person of the Godhead
is termed Father. All men are declared to be His offspring, and
those who have received the Spirit of adoption cry, "Abba,
Father," and are taught, when they pray, to say, "Our
Father."</p>
<p>In an exposition of the Creed the Fatherhood in relation to
men generally, or to believers in particular, need not be
considered. Here the name is used to indicate the relation in
which the First Person stands to the Second, in virtue of which
alone those who are adopted into fellowship with the Son become
the children of God&mdash;the children of Christ's Father and
their Father. The Scriptures teach that the Father is God, that
the Son is God, and that the Holy Ghost is God. At the same time
the doctrine of the Divine Unity is affirmed.</p>
<p>The difficulty felt in connection with the doctrine of Trinity
in Unity has led to attempts in ancient and modern times to show
that those passages of Scripture in which it appears to be taught
may be otherwise interpreted. One explanation is, from the name
of its first exponent, termed Sabellianism, or, the doctrine of a
Modal Trinity. The view which it presents of the Divine Being is
that the same Person manifests Himself at one time and in one
relation as Father, at another time and in another relation as
Son, and at a different time and in another relation as Holy
Ghost. It attributes divinity to this One Divine Person in each
of His manifestations, but denies that there are three Persons in
the Godhead. The facts of Scripture do not accord with such a
view of the Divine Personality. We find each Person addressing
the Others and speaking of Himself and of Them as distinct
Persons. Each speaking of Himself says "I." The Father says
"Thou" to the Son, the Son says "Thou" to the Father, and the
Father and the Son use the pronouns "He" and "Him" with reference
to the Spirit. The Father loves the Son, the Son loves the
Father, the Spirit testifies of the Son.<a name=
"FNanchor024"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_024"><sup>[024]</sup></a></p>
<p>In the Athanasian Creed we find the following statement of
this doctrine:&mdash;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em;">"This is the Catholic Faith, that
we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity. Neither
confounding the Persons nor dividing the Substance. For the
Person of the Father is one, of the Son another, of the Holy
Ghost another. But the divinity of the Father and the Son and of
the Holy Ghost is one, the glory equal, the majesty equal. Such
as is the Father, such also is the Son, and such the Holy Spirit.
The Father is uncreated, the Son is uncreated, the Holy Spirit is
uncreated. The Father is infinite, the Son is infinite, the Holy
Ghost is infinite. The Father is eternal, the Son is eternal, the
Holy Ghost is eternal. And yet these are not three eternal Beings
but one eternal Being. As also there are not three uncreated
beings, nor three infinite beings, but one uncreated and one
infinite Being."</div>
<p>It is sometimes said that the doctrine of the Trinity is of
little practical importance, but such a view of it is
inconsistent with the teaching of Scripture, and with the atoning
work of Christ. It is the Divinity of the Son that gives efficacy
to His sacrifice. As sinners we need pardon. Pardon must be
preceded by propitiation, and if Christ is not Divine there is no
propitiation. The doctrines of Scripture are so linked together
that the rejection of one invalidates the others. If we deny the
Trinity we deny the Gospel message of salvation, and we
accordingly find that most of those who reject the doctrine of
the Trinity do not believe in the reality and efficacy of
Christ's atonement.</p>
<br>

<p>SECTION 4.&mdash;ALMIGHTY</p>
<br>

<p>The term "Almighty," which occurs twice in the Creed,
represents two Greek words, the one denoting absolute dominion,
the other infinite power in operation. When we say that God the
Father is Almighty, we affirm that He is possessed of entire
freedom of action, and that His power is unlimited. He cannot,
indeed, act in opposition to His own nature. In executing His
eternal decrees none can stay His hand from working, but He can
do nothing that would derogate from His eternal power and
Godhead. Such inability has its origin not in any limitation of
power, or restriction imposed from without, but in Himself. He
knows all things and so cannot be tempted of evil. He can do
whatever He wills, but His will cannot contradict His
character.</p>
<p>The statement that God is Almighty implies that all beings are
governed and controlled by Him. All things, save Himself, are His
creatures and subject to Him. Even those things that seem to
resist and defy His authority are under His government. Rebellion
serves but to make His omnipotence more apparent, for He causeth
the wrath of man to praise Him, and the remainder of wrath He
restraineth.<a name="FNanchor025"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_025"><sup>[025]</sup></a> He so governs the universe
that all things work together, and work together for good to them
that love Him.<a name="FNanchor026"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_026"><sup>[026]</sup></a></p>
<p>When we say, "God the Father Almighty," it is not meant that
the Son and the Holy Ghost are not Almighty. The Father is
Almighty because He is God, the Son, who is one with the Father,
is God and therefore Almighty, and the Holy Ghost is also God and
therefore Almighty. In the unity of the Godhead the same
attributes mark the three Persons.</p>
<br>

<p>SECTION 5.&mdash;MAKER OF HEAVEN AND EARTH</p>
<br>

<p>Belief in the Almighty power of God is further declared by a
confession of faith in Him as the Maker of heaven and earth, and
this is but a repetition of the statement contained in the first
chapter of Genesis&mdash;the only account of Creation which is
fitted to solve all difficulties and to meet all objections.
"Maker" in this article is used in the sense of Creator, implying
that heaven and earth were called into existence out of nothing
by the word of Divine power; and by "heaven and earth" are meant
all creatures, visible and invisible, that have existed or do
exist.</p>
<p>Those who object to the Scripture statements regarding
Creation have maintained views as to the origin of the material
universe differing largely from those held by persons who accept
this article of the Creed, and differing also greatly from one
another. Various solutions have been given, among which may be
stated:&mdash;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em;">(<i>a</i>) The view of those who
hold that all phenomena and all existence originate in Chance or
a blind fortuitous concourse of atoms. To state such a doctrine
is to refute it. No one possessed of reason can believe in his
heart that Intelligence did not create and organise matter, or
that the material universe, with all its adaptation of parts, was
evolved, and is governed, by chance or accident. This theory, if
it is worthy of the name, seems to have been devised in order to
evade the idea that man is subject to Divine government.<br>
<br>
 (<i>b</i>) Another view is that all existence owes its origin to
Fate or Necessity and is now held in its resistless grasp. The
advocates of this theory are at variance among themselves. One
school maintains that all things existed from eternity in their
present condition, and are destined to continue as they are,
controlled by relentless and undeviating necessity. Another
school&mdash;the ancient Fatalists&mdash;held that at first there
was a fortuitous concourse of atoms and phenomena, until Fate or
Chance decided the present order, which became an established
necessity. A third class hold doctrines of Development. Some of
them agree with the ancient Fatalists in maintaining that
development, in a fortuitous concourse and action of matter and
force, issued in evolution or originated a course of evolution.
Others again deny fortuitous concourse and affirm that this
process of evolution had no external beginning, but has continued
from eternity under the control of evolutionary law. The term
"law" as used by them has no specific meaning, and is simply an
adaptation, to a theory naturally atheistic, of a word which may
serve to commend their doctrine. The "law" of which they speak
has its origin in matter itself, and is not under the control of
a Supreme Intelligence. That this is the fact is shown by the
denial of free-will in man and of the superintending providence
of God; of the efficacy of prayer and of the forgiveness of sin;
and by the prominence given in their writings to the absolute
control of all things by undeviating, unchanging law.<br>
<br>
 (<i>c</i>) A third view affirms that while there is a
distinction between the Ego and the non-Ego (the me and the
not-me), it is impossible to know anything about either in its
essence. That they exist and that they are different are facts
within our knowledge, but as to the absolute nature of mind and
matter we can discover and believe nothing. The ultimate or
absolute is beyond our reach, as is the infinite and
unconditioned. We can have no knowledge of First Causes, or of
the Ultimate Cause, or of the Absolute Cause. The infinite cannot
even be apprehended, and those who undertake to learn or to
speculate regarding the infinite engage in a task beyond their
powers. Such knowledge is not practical. The term "God" is merely
an expression for a mode of the unknowable, conveying no meaning
to those who use it. The view thus expressed originated in
concessions unhappily made by certain writers, as Sir William
Hamilton and Dean Mansel, who, thinking to defend revealed
religion, taught that reason cannot know the Infinite, and that
therefore the Infinite must reveal Himself. Herbert Spencer took
advantage of this concession, and carried it to a logical
conclusion, when he argued that, if reason could not know or
apprehend the Infinite by reason, neither could it by
revelation.<br>
<br>
 (<i>d</i>) Another class hold the view which is termed
cosmogonies than that of Moses, whether contained in the sacred
books of religions that have long existed, or professing to be
based on modern scientific discovery, raise difficulties that are
insuperable. Whence came matter if not from the creative word of
God? To assign eternity to it is to invest it with an attribute
that is Divine, and Pantheists carry such an explanation to its
logical conclusion when they affirm that the universe is God. The
existence of a single atom is an unfathomable mystery. Man cannot
create or destroy even a particle of matter. How overwhelming,
then, if we reject the simple statement of the Bible, is the
mystery of the great universe, in whose extended space suns,
planets, stars, and systems unceasingly revolve, and in which our
own world is but a little speck. All things created point to God
as their origin and source. "The invisible things of him from the
creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the
things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead."<a name=
"FNanchor027"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_027"><sup>[027]</sup></a><br>
</div>
<p>"I asked the earth," wrote Augustine in his
<i>Confessions</i>, "and it answered me, 'I am not He.' And
whatsoever things are in it confirmed the same. I asked the sea
and the deeps and the living creeping things, and they answered,
'We are not thy God, seek above us.' I asked the morning air, and
the whole air with its inhabitants answered, 'Anaximenes was
deceived, we are not thy God.' I asked the heavens, sun, moon,
stars, 'Nor,' say they, 'are we the God whom thou seekest.' And I
replied unto all the things which encompass the door of my flesh,
'Ye have told me of my God that ye are not He: tell me something
more of Him.' And they cried out with a loud voice, 'He made

<br>

<p><i>And in Jesus Christ His only Son our Lord</i></p>
<p>SECTION 1.&mdash;AND IN JESUS CHRIST</p>
<br>

<p>The first article of the Apostles' Creed has numerous
adherents. Jews and Christians are at one in affirming their
belief in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth.
Many too who, unlike Jews and Christians, have not been favoured
with a written revelation, have yet risen to the conception of
such a Divine Being as that article sets forth. Mohammedans
believe in an Omnipotent Creator, and many thoughtful heathens
have accepted and maintained the doctrine as an article of faith.
It expresses a conviction reached by Plato and Aristotle, by
Seneca and Epictetus, and is a truth proclaimed by Old Testament
prophets and New Testament saints. No belief regarding things
invisible is more generally professed.</p>
<p>It is otherwise with the second article of the Creed, "I
believe in Jesus Christ His only Son our Lord," which expresses
doctrines so hotly disputed that they prove the saying true,
"This child is set for a sign which shall be spoken against."<a
name="FNanchor029"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_029"><sup>[029]</sup></a> It is rejected by the Jew
and the Mohammedan, and finds opponents in many who profess to
accept the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments as a Divine
revelation, and to regard the exemplary life of Jesus as a model
to be copied, while they deny His Divine origin, His sacrificial
death, and His universal authority.</p>
<p>The early controversies concerning the Second Person of the
Trinity were disputes regarding His nature and the relation in
which He stands to the Father. Certain heretics affirmed that
Jesus was a mere man, selected by God and specially endowed with
the gift of His Spirit. Others maintained that Christ was not
God, but a created spirit, nearest to the Father in dignity, who
took upon Him human nature, and, having finished the work
appointed Him on earth, went up again to God the Father. One
class, the Ebionites, regarded Him as a being essentially human,
though begotten of the Spirit, by whom He was anointed above
measure; while another, the Docetae, regarded Him as a Divine
Being seemingly bearing human form and united with the man Jesus.
These views were finally rejected by the Catholic Church, because
they conflicted with the Word of God which affirms the true
Divinity of the Son of God, the true humanity of the Son of Man,
and the true union of the two natures of God and man in One
Person, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The Gnostics, who were the leaders in connection with such
heretical views, are generally thought to date from the time of
Simon Magus. He had been enrolled as a disciple of the Apostles,
and, professing faith in Christ, was baptized by Peter. But he
had joined the Christian Church for selfish ends,<a name=
"FNanchor030"></a><a href="#Footnote_030"><sup>[030]</sup></a> as
Luke's statements show. Hymenaeus,<a name="FNanchor031"></a><a
href="#Footnote_031"><sup>[031]</sup></a> Phygellus, and
Hermogenes,<a name="FNanchor032"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_032"><sup>[032]</sup></a> referred to by Paul in his
second letter to Timothy, are believed to have been Gnostics, and
towards the close of the first century Cerinthus and Ebion
extended the system.<a name="FNanchor033"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_033"><sup>[033]</sup></a></p>
<br>

<p>SECTION 2.&mdash;JESUS</p>
<br>

<p>Jesus is the personal name of our Lord. In ancient times names
had often a meaning and importance which they do not carry now.
"Name" means a word by which any person or thing is known, and
names were originally given from some quality attribute inherent
in the person or thing to which they were attached. Proper names
among the Hebrews had a deeper meaning and a closer connection
with character and condition than elsewhere. The care that marks
the Scriptures in recording the origin of names of individuals
and places, the frequent allusions to names as having a special
relation to character or qualities, the solemnity with which a
change of name is stated as marking an epoch in the history of
individuals or nations, and the frequency with which names are
associated with great events, with promises, threats, or
prophecies, show the importance that was attached to them. This
feature is most marked in the use by the Jews of the word "Name"
in reference to God. The "Name of the Lord," or an equivalent
expression, constantly occurs to denote God Himself. His Name is
in Scripture identified with His character, marking His
attributes and His nature as distinguished from all other beings.
The Name, Jehovah, by which God revealed Himself to Moses was so
closely identified by the Jews with the Divine Personality and
Holiness that it was never pronounced by them.</p>
<p>In Old Testament times the Deliverer foretold as the object of
faith and hope and love under the Gospel Dispensation was
announced by a declaration of His name. "His name shall be called
Wonderful, Counsellor, the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father,
the Prince of Peace."<a name="FNanchor034"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_034"><sup>[034]</sup></a> Immediately before He
appeared a messenger was sent from heaven with the Divine
command, "Thou shalt call his name Jesus: for he shall save his
people from their sins."<a name="FNanchor035"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_035"><sup>[035]</sup></a> The name is thus not the
ascription to Him of qualities evolved from our own conception of
what He is, or of what God is in Him, but God's disclosure of His
infinite love and of His purposes for man's salvation. In His
Divine power and by His efficacious sacrifice He is Jesus, the
Saviour. He does not save, as some who profess to be Christians
hold, by the influence of His own example and teaching only, just
as one man may be said to save another whom he persuades to
abandon evil habits and form good ones. He is our Saviour because
He died as a sacrifice for our sins. Had He not expiated our
guilt by dying for us, His example, teaching, and sympathy would
never have brought us salvation.</p>
<p>The name "Jesus" is a human name. In its Hebrew form Joshua,
Jehoshua, Hosea it had been borne by others. We read of one Jesus
in the New Testament<a name="FNanchor036"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_036"><sup>[036]</sup></a> and of many in the pages of
Josephus. In this respect, as in other particulars, Jesus was
"made like unto his brethren" and bore a human distinctive name.
"Jesus" was accordingly the name given to Him at His
circumcision, by which He was to be known in His family and among
the people of Nazareth. During His ministry He was described as
"Jesus, the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee";<a name=
"FNanchor037"></a><a href="#Footnote_037"><sup>[037]</sup></a>
and the title affixed to His cross by Pilate was "Jesus of
Nazareth, the King of the Jews." Yet, as if to make emphatic the
truth that His humanity did not derogate from His Divine power
and Godhead, the first Evangelist, who describes the angel's
visit, quotes in immediate connection Isaiah's prophetic
announcement, "They shall call his name Emmanuel, which being
interpreted is, GOD with us."<a name="FNanchor038"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_038"><sup>[038]</sup></a> In the name Jesus thus
bestowed we have the announcement of Himself as a personal
Saviour from sin, in its power and consequences. Of those who had
borne it before Him some were raised up to deliver the people of
their nation from suffering in time, but He came to be man's
everlasting Saviour. "Neither is there salvation in any other:
for there is none other name under heaven given among men,
whereby we must be saved."<a name="FNanchor039"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_039"><sup>[039]</sup></a> It is important therefore to
bear in mind that Jesus is a name not only given to Him by God,
but a name itself Divine; not only the name by which, as that of
a Mediator, we worship God, but the name under which, as that of
God Himself, we worship Him. "God also hath highly exalted him,
and given him a name which is above every name: that at the name
of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things
in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue
should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the
Father."<a name="FNanchor040"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_040"><sup>[040]</sup></a></p>
<br>

<p>SECTION 3.&mdash;CHRIST</p>
<br>

<p>In ancient times no such appellations as those now termed
surnames were given to individuals. One name only was
distinctive. Both among the Jews and among the Greeks this system
of nomenclature prevailed, family names being unknown. It was
different with the Romans, by many of whom more names than one
were borne. In reading ancient Greek history, we find illustrious
personages known by one name only, as Plato, Aristotle, Socrates,
Solon. The same feature marks early Jewish history. Abraham,
Isaac, Moses, Job were not known by any other names than these.
Sometimes names were changed or modified in order to express some
speciality of character or achievement&mdash;Abram to Abraham,
Jacob to Israel, Hoshea to Joshua. In later times appellations
descriptive of the work or office of individuals were attached to
their original names, as in the cases of John the Baptist, of
Matthew the Publican, and of our Lord Himself, Jesus the Christ.
This latter practice prevailed in early English history, and
famous kings appear bearing descriptive epithets in addition to
their original single names&mdash;Alfred the Great, Edward the
Confessor, William the Conqueror.</p>
<p>Christ is not a proper name but an official title. Although
now often used to designate the person of the Lord Jesus, it was
not so when He lived in the world. As John was the Baptist or
Baptizer, Jesus was the Christ&mdash;the Anointed. The title is
the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew Messiah, and means the
Anointed. It denotes that He who bore it was separated,
consecrated, and invested with high office. These distinctions
met in Jesus, rendering the title appropriate.</p>
<p>At the time of the birth of Jesus, the coming of a great
deliverer was at once the desire and the expectation not of Jews
only, but of many nations. Roman historians of that period tell
us that a redeemer was to make his appearance from among the
nation of Israel. This belief was no doubt spread abroad by
Jewish exiles, who, scattered through many lands, carried with
them the hopes and prophecies which had been given from time to
time to their own people.</p>
<p>That the expected Messiah had come to the world bearing with
Him from heaven a message of salvation was the cardinal doctrine
of Apostolic preaching. To accept Jesus as the Christ was to
accept Him as the Saviour and Deliverer. When Andrew found his
brother Simon he said to him, "We have found the Messias."<a
name="FNanchor041"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_041"><sup>[041]</sup></a> "Is not this the Christ?"<a
name="FNanchor042"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_042"><sup>[042]</sup></a> was the appeal of the woman
of Samaria to the people of her city; and the confession of Peter
that Jesus was the Christ, was declared by our Lord to be a
revelation not of flesh and blood, but of His Father in heaven.<a
name="FNanchor043"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_043"><sup>[043]</sup></a> Not Apollos only, but Paul
and the other inspired teachers also, set it before them as their
appointed work, "to show by the Scriptures that Jesus was
Christ."<a name="FNanchor044"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_044"><sup>[044]</sup></a> To confess that Jesus was
the Christ was an acknowledgment that in Him were vested all
those attributes and qualities which the Old Testament Scriptures
ascribed to Messiah, that Jesus of Nazareth was the Deliverer of
whom the prophets testified, to whose coming all the holy men of
old looked forward, whom prophets and kings desired to see, and
of whom all Scripture bore witness. It was the acknowledgment by
the common people that Jesus was Messiah that stirred the
indignation of the Jewish rulers. They saw that, if this were
conceded, all His claims must be held valid, and accordingly the
Sanhedrim passed a resolution to the effect that, "if any man did
confess that Jesus was Christ, he should be put out of the
synagogue."<a name="FNanchor045"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_045"><sup>[045]</sup></a></p>
<p>The name "Christ" denotes the offices which Jesus executes as
our Redeemer. Three classes were set apart by anointing&mdash;the
Prophet, who made known the will of God; the Priest, who
confessed sin and offered sacrifice for the people; and the King,
who acted as their leader and commander. Jesus was consecrated
for His work as our Redeemer by anointing, but not, so far as we
know, with material oil. He who anointed Him was God the Father,
and the oil that descended upon Him was the Holy Ghost, of whose
influence oil was the symbol. "God, even thy God, hath anointed
thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows."<a name=
"FNanchor046"></a><a href="#Footnote_046"><sup>[046]</sup></a> He
fulfilled the office of a Prophet by revealing the Father, and
making known the will of God for our salvation; of a Priest in
the sacrifice of Himself which He offered up to God for us, and
in the intercession which He makes on our behalf at His Father's
right hand; of a King in the victory He won over man's enemies,
and in the power He imparts to His people, by which they overcome
evil in themselves and in the world. It was not until after He
had finished His work that His followers so closely associated
Him with the Messiahship as to speak of Him not as Jesus only,
nor as Christ only, but as Jesus Christ. This twofold name occurs
very rarely in the Gospels&mdash;once in Matthew, once in Mark,
never in Luke; but in the Epistles it is the name by which He is
designated and made known to the world. To believe in Jesus
Christ is to accept Him in all His offices, and to take home the
truth which John had in view when he penned his Gospel: "These
are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the
Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his
name."<a name="FNanchor047"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_047"><sup>[047]</sup></a></p>
<br>

<p>SECTION 4.&mdash;HIS ONLY SON</p>
<br>

<p>God is love. Love must have an object, and from eternity the
Father was not alone. The only-begotten and well-beloved Son was
with Him, dwelt in His bosom, and shared His glory. The Filiation
or Sonship of our Lord follows the statement of His proper name
and the declaration of His Messiahship. It is expressed in the
designation, "Only Son," which is His divine name, peculiar to
Himself, incommunicable to any other being. He is the Son of the
Father, and is His only Son inasmuch as He alone partakes of His
Divine nature, and in this nature is the Son. The Old Testament
Scriptures foretold that Christ should be the Son of God. "I will
declare the decree: the Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son;
this day have I begotten thee."<a name="FNanchor048"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_048"><sup>[048]</sup></a> Isaiah wrote of Him, "Unto
us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government
shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called
Wonderful, Counsellor, the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father,
the Prince of Peace."<a name="FNanchor049"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_049"><sup>[049]</sup></a> The New Testament in various
passages bears the same testimony. "In the beginning," says John,
"was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God";
and "the Word," he goes on to say, "became flesh, and dwelt among
us, (and we beheld his glory, glory as of the only begotten from
the Father,) full of grace and truth."<a name=
"FNanchor050"></a><a href="#Footnote_050"><sup>[050]</sup></a>
The writer to the Hebrews makes a similar declaration: "God, who
at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the
fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us
by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom
also he made the worlds; who is the brightness of his glory, and
the express image of his person."<a name="FNanchor051"></a><a
href="#Footnote_051"><sup>[051]</sup></a> It has been noted that
Christ, in speaking to His disciples, never says <i>our</i>
Father, but either <i>My</i> Father, or <i>your</i> Father, or
both conjoined, never leaving it to be inferred that God is in
the same sense His Father and our Father. It appears from various
passages in the New Testament, that when He came the Jews
identified Messiah with the Son of God, as when Nathanael
exclaimed, "Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of
Israel";<a name="FNanchor052"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_052"><sup>[052]</sup></a> and when Martha said, "I
believe that thou art the Son of God, which should come into the
world."<a name="FNanchor053"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_053"><sup>[053]</sup></a> He did not first become the
Son of God when He took upon Him the nature of man. The Divine
Sonship existed in the beginning before He was the child of Mary,
the seed of the woman. He was the Son of God before the birth of
Abraham: "before Abraham was I am."<a name="FNanchor054"></a><a
href="#Footnote_054"><sup>[054]</sup></a> Though John the Baptist
was older than Jesus, and preceded Him in His ministry, Jesus was
yet preferred in honour before him, "for he was before him." "The
Lord possessed him in the beginning of his way, before his works
of old."<a name="FNanchor055"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_055"><sup>[055]</sup></a> In the relation of the Son
to the Father, there is a mystery which we cannot solve. "Who
shall declare his generation?" Earthly figures fail to set forth
Divine realities, and as we are dependent upon human emblems for
the conceptions we form of heavenly things, we see through a
glass darkly. But though we cannot fully understand the sense in
which our Lord is the Son of God, we yet believe that He is so in
a manner analogous to that in which we are our fathers'
sons&mdash;possessing the same nature as His Father, and having
that nature communicated to Him as the only-begotten Son. God has
other sons. Angels are termed sons of God. Men are also His
offspring, and believers are now the sons of God; but Jesus is
God's son in a higher, special, and perfect sense.</p>
<p>That Jesus claimed to be in this sense the Son of God is clear
from many incidents in His history. It was ostensibly on the
ground that He declared Himself to be "equal with God" that He
was arrested and condemned by the Jewish rulers. The high priest
put the question to Him directly and solemnly, "I adjure thee by
the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the
Son of God." The reply was distinct and emphatic. "Jesus said, I
am: Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right
hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven."<a name=
"FNanchor056"></a><a href="#Footnote_056"><sup>[056]</sup></a>
There is no resisting the meaning which these words convey. The
Sonship they assert is very different from that which is implied
when a mere man who fears God and keeps His commandments is said
to be a son of God. It was a claim to the possession of Divine
personality and power, and was so understood by His accusers.
When Caiaphas heard the reply he accepted it in its full
significance, tearing his clothes and exclaiming, "He hath spoken
blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye
have heard his blasphemy. What think ye? They answered and said,
He is guilty of death."<a name="FNanchor057"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_057"><sup>[057]</sup></a></p>
<p>His saying that He was the Son of God was the "blasphemy" for
which He was condemned. The horror, real or affected, and the
rent robes of the high priest, the verdict of the court, and the
contemptuous treatment to which Jesus was afterwards subjected,
leave no room for doubting that He declared Himself to be the Son
of God, having at His disposal the powers of heaven and
earth.</p>
<br>

<p>SECTION 5&mdash;OUR LORD</p>
<br>

<p>The last title of the Second Person is expressive of His
dominion. The name "Lord" is the translation of a Greek word,
which signifies ruling or governing. Jesus Christ is not only a
Lord, He rules by authority and in a sense peculiar to Himself,
so that He is commonly spoken of in the New Testament as "the
Lord": "Come, see the place where the Lord lay";<a name=
"FNanchor058"></a><a href="#Footnote_058"><sup>[058]</sup></a>
"They have taken the Lord out of the sepulchre";<a name=
"FNanchor059"></a><a href="#Footnote_059"><sup>[059]</sup></a> "I
have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you."
In the time of Christ the title "Lord" had for Jews and Jewish
Christians a special personal meaning. "The Lord" was in the
Septuagint, as it is still in the Authorised English version of
the Old Testament, the translation of "Jehovah."<a name=
"FNanchor060"></a><a href="#Footnote_060"><sup>[060]</sup></a>
When, therefore, the Apostles used this title to designate their
Master, there is reason to think that they did so in the full
belief that He was one with the Father. This view is confirmed by
Paul's statement. "To us there is but one God, the Father, of
whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by
whom are all things, and we by him."<a name="FNanchor061"></a><a
href="#Footnote_061"><sup>[061]</sup></a> As Lord, the government
is upon His shoulders, His dominion is universal and His kingdom
everlasting. This He claims for Himself "All power is given unto
me in heaven and in earth";<a name="FNanchor062"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_062"><sup>[062]</sup></a> "All things are delivered
unto me of my Father";<a name="FNanchor063"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_063"><sup>[063]</sup></a> "The Father loveth the Son,
and hath given all things into his hand."<a name=
"FNanchor064"></a><a href="#Footnote_064"><sup>[064]</sup></a>
"God hath highly exalted him, and given him a name above every
name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things
in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and
that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to
the glory of God the Father."<a name="FNanchor065"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_065"><sup>[065]</sup></a></p>
<p>While Christ is the "Lord of all,"<a name="FNanchor066"></a><a
href="#Footnote_066"><sup>[066]</sup></a> the Creed yet sets
forth the truth that there is a special sense in which He is the
Lord of believers, "our Lord."</p>
<p>Scripture recognises the existence in the universe of two
great armies, marshalled under their respective leaders&mdash;one
under the rule of Jesus Christ, the other under His adversary
the Devil, otherwise termed Satan, Apollyon, and the Old Serpent.
These powers are in constant antagonism, and every man takes his
place in the army of Christ or in that of Satan. Those opposed to
the Lord are rebels who, except they repent, must share the doom
of their leader in the place prepared for the devil and his
angels; "for He must reign until He hath put all His enemies
under His feet." He is their Lord for their overthrow and
destruction; while to those who are "with Him,"&mdash;"the
called, and chosen, and faithful,"<a name="FNanchor067"></a><a
href="#Footnote_067"><sup>[067]</sup></a>&mdash;He is their Lord
to secure for them victory and everlasting salvation. When we use
the expression "our Lord," we declare that we renounce other
masters; that we make no compromise with His enemies, and refuse
to have "fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness"; that,
renouncing the Devil and his works, rejecting the vain pleasures,
pomps, and glories of the world, and denying ourselves the
gratification of sinful desires, we accept Christ as our leader,
with the determination expressed by the prophet, "O Lord our God,
other lords beside thee have had dominion over us: but by thee
only will we make mention of thy name."<a name=
"FNanchor068"></a><a href="#Footnote_068"><sup>[068]</sup></a> As
the followers and subjects of an omnipotent, righteous King we
shall strive to "bring into captivity every thought to the
obedience of Christ."</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that a plural pronoun is used in this
recognition of Christ as <i>our</i> Lord, while elsewhere
throughout the Creed the confession of belief is personal, "I
believe." The plural form here indicates that while in following
Jesus we are separated from the world, we are gathered into the
fellowship of the saints, and are members of the whole family in
heaven and earth.</p>

<p><i>Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin
Mary</i></p>
<br>

<p>The Creed proceeds to declare belief in the doctrine of the
Incarnation, which is thus set forth in the Shorter Catechism:
"Christ, the Son of God, became man, by taking to Himself a true
body, and a reasonable soul, being conceived by the power of the
Holy Ghost, in the womb of the Virgin Mary, and born of her, yet
without sin."<a name="FNanchor069"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_069"><sup>[069]</sup></a></p>
<p>Two Evangelists record the miraculous birth of Jesus. Mark and
John do not refer to it, and their silence has led some opponents
of Christianity to discredit the statements of Matthew and Luke.
But while there is no direct account given by Mark or John of the
miraculous conception and birth of Jesus, the fact of His Divine
descent is implied in many portions of their Gospels. The words
with which Mark opens his narrative clearly express it, "The
beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;"<a name=
"FNanchor070"></a><a href="#Footnote_070"><sup>[070]</sup></a> as
does the statement he makes that at His baptism there came a
voice from heaven saying, "Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am
well pleased."<a name="FNanchor071"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_071"><sup>[071]</sup></a> John is equally explicit in
declaring his belief in the Divinity of Jesus. The opening words
of his Gospel assert His Divine nature: "In the beginning was the
Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same
was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and
without him was not anything made that was made."<a name=
"FNanchor072"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_072"><sup>[072]</sup></a></p>
<p>It is evident, therefore, that each of the Evangelists
believed in the Divine origin of Jesus, for they would not have
used such language regarding one who in their opinion was a mere
man, the son of Joseph the carpenter and of Mary his espoused
wife. Matthew, who wrote for Jewish converts, shows how fully the
Old Testament prophecy was accomplished that Christ should be
born, not at Nazareth but at Bethlehem, and especially that
Isaiah's prophecy, "Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and
shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel,
which being interpreted is, GOD with us,"<a name=
"FNanchor073"></a><a href="#Footnote_073"><sup>[073]</sup></a>
was fulfilled in the birth of Jesus Christ. Luke, who is termed
by Paul "the beloved physician," gives the fullest account of the
Nativity. His writings are characterised by minuteness of detail
and historical accuracy. Recent investigations have shown that,
even in regard to matters about which he was long thought to have
been mistaken, Luke's statements are strictly correct.<a name=
"FNanchor074"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_074"><sup>[074]</sup></a></p>
<p>The story of the miraculous conception would not, without the
strongest corroborative evidence, have commended itself to a man
of his acumen and his calling. A physician by profession, the
companion of Apostles, and possessing singular penetration and
sagacity, he tells us that he had received the facts he narrates
from eye witnesses and competent authorities. For information as
to the events connected with the birth of her Son, Luke would
naturally have recourse to Mary. There is evidence in his Gospel
that he had intimate knowledge of her private thoughts and
actions.<a name="FNanchor075"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_075"><sup>[075]</sup></a> Lange, in his <i>Life of
Jesus</i>, finds in the specialties of the narrative evidence of
a woman's diction.<a name="FNanchor076"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_076"><sup>[076]</sup></a> Be this as it may, the
minuteness of detail, the message of the angel Gabriel, the
preservation of the sacred songs, and of the thoughts and words
of the Virgin, justify the belief that Luke received his
information from herself. When we find him assuring his friend
Theophilus that he himself had perfect understanding of all
things from the very first, the inference is natural that his
information was obtained from the most trustworthy sources. There
is no reason to doubt that Mary was associated with the Apostles
of her Son, and had opportunities of imparting information
regarding Him which no other could supply Luke's account
corresponds with that of John, to whose care Jesus from the Cross
committed His mother, and who from that time "took her unto his
own home."<a name="FNanchor077"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_077"><sup>[077]</sup></a></p>
<p>It does not necessarily follow, even if the information was
supplied by Mary, that it is therefore to be accepted as true.
Human witnesses are not infallible or invariably honest, and it
is conceivable that Mary may have been a dreamer or a deceiver.
This article of the Creed, contradicting as it does the ordinary
course of nature, stands in need of more than a historic
statement. Jesus admitted that if His claims had been supported
by no other evidence than His own word, the Jews would have had
excuse for hesitating to accept Him. "If," said He, "I bear
witness of myself, my witness is not true,"<a name=
"FNanchor078"></a><a href="#Footnote_078"><sup>[078]</sup></a>
and therefore He appealed to the testimony borne to His
Messiahship by His Father, by John the Baptist, by His miracles,
and by His life. All the evidence by which the Divine nature and
mission of Jesus were accredited goes to support the account of
His super natural birth.</p>
<p>That Jesus was born of Mary is a plain historic truth to which
all must accord belief. "Yes," said Renan, who did not regard
Christ as the Son of God, "this story of Jesus is no fable, but a
true history Christ really lived." The miraculous birth was a
fulfilment of prophecy. When the angel told Mary that the child
to be born of her would be the Son of God, he cited Isaiah's
prophecy for the confirmation of her faith, and indeed the same
truth had been foreshadowed when the promise was given to Eve
that her seed should bruise the head of the serpent. The first
Adam had no human father. He was the Son of God. It was therefore
fitting that the second Adam should resemble the first in this
respect, being in a sense infinitely higher than our first father
the Son of God, His only Son. It was fitting too that He who was
to assume the nature, not of any branch of the human family but
of universal man, should be conceived by the Holy Ghost. Other
faiths than Christianity are limited in their adaptation to
races. The religion of Mahomet is not practicable save in Eastern
latitudes. The Koran enjoins as duties practices that cannot be
carried out in Western countries. The faiths of Brahma and Buddha
find followers only under Eastern skies, and even Judaism
required observances which could be rendered at Jerusalem only.
All faiths but Christianity are narrowed down by the
nationalities of their founders or adherents. It is otherwise
with the religion of Jesus of Nazareth. He came from God with a
mission and a message for the world. In comparison with the
severe requirements of the law and the grievous exactions of
religions devised by men, His "yoke is easy and His burden is
light." With Him there is "neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision
nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free."<a name=

<p>In being born, Jesus assumed the nature of humanity, and, in
so doing, more than restored to man the likeness to God which our
first parents lost, for themselves and their descendants, through
the Fall. He thereby made it possible for God to dwell with man,
and for man to rise into communion with God. Sin had effaced the
Divine image, and no other than the Son of God could give back to
men the power to reflect in their own lives the character of God.
His possession of the human nature gives us confidence in
approaching Him, by assuring us of His brotherhood and sympathy;
while His possession of the Divine nature assures us that He can
make His brotherhood and sympathy effectual.</p>

<p><i>Suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and
buried</i></p>
<p>SECTION 1.&mdash;SUFFERED UNDER PONTIUS PILATE</p>
<br>

<p>The preceding articles of the Creed appeal to faith. They so
far transcend reason that they can be apprehended only when
reason is sustained by faith. This article, which affirms that
Jesus "suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and
buried," is a simple historical statement. Pilate is a historic
person, the details of whose life are recorded, not in the
Gospels only, but in secular history. Josephus records several
incidents in the life of Pilate which are strikingly in
accordance with his character as set forth in the Gospels.
Tacitus, a Roman historian, who wrote his <i>Annals</i> soon
after the crucifixion of Jesus, relates that, while Pilate was
governor of Judaea, Jesus Christ was put to death. The testimony
of the Gospels and the statement of the Creed are thus confirmed
by the Roman and the Jewish historians. But, indeed, the event
itself is not the subject of controversy. It is the conclusions
drawn from it by the followers of Christ that are disputed.
"Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling-block, and to the
Greeks foolishness,"<a name="FNanchor081"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_081"><sup>[081]</sup></a> still raises opposition
and kindles hostility.</p>
<p>The name of Pilate is inserted not with the view of branding
him with infamy, but in order to fix the date of the crucifixion
of Jesus. It is the only intimation of the time of His death that
the Creed contains. It states that He was born, and that His
mother was the Virgin Mary, and beyond this reference to Pilate
there is no intimation as to the time of the nativity or the
death. Bishop Pearson writes:&mdash;"As the Son of God, by His
deliberate counsel, was sent into the world to die in the fulness
of time, so it concerns the Church to know the time in which He
died. And because the ancient custom of the world was to make
computations by the governors, and refer their historical
relations to the respective times of their government, therefore,
that we might be properly assured of the actions of our Saviour
which He did, and of His sufferings,&mdash;that is the actions
which others did to Him,&mdash;the present governor is named in
that form of speech which is proper to such historical or
chronological narrations when we affirm that He suffered under
Pontius Pilate."<a name="FNanchor082"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_082"><sup>[082]</sup></a> From stating the birth of
Christ, the Creed passes by what at first sight may seem an
abrupt transition to His suffering, crucifixion, and death. There
is no reference to His life or works, though these differed so
widely from those of ordinary men. The reason seems to be that
the end for which He came into the world was to suffer and die.
Although He spake as never man spake, and did the works no other
man did, it was not in the first place to teach or to work
miracles that He emptied Himself of His glory and came to earth,
but in order to suffer and die in the room and stead of sinners.
Others had been prophets and teachers, others had worked
miracles, others had done good in their day and generation, but
none save Jesus had come in his own name or wielded power so
marvellous as His. No one could share with Him the work of
suffering and dying for sinners. He was lifted up that He might
draw all men unto Him. "He suffered the just for the unjust, that
he might bring us to God."<a name="FNanchor083"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_083"><sup>[083]</sup></a> On the cross He tasted death
for every man, and made a sacrificial atonement for the sins of
the world. "He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised
for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him;
and with his stripes we are healed."<a name="FNanchor084"></a><a
href="#Footnote_084"><sup>[084]</sup></a> His dying was the
leading thought and purpose of His life. Those who were with Him
fixed their eyes on His greatness as manifested in His wisdom and
miracles, and looked for His setting up a kingdom of this world,
but He Himself from the very beginning knew that the path to be
traversed by Him was one of agony and death. He was straitened
until this baptism of suffering should be accomplished.<a name=
"FNanchor085"></a><a href="#Footnote_085"><sup>[085]</sup></a> At
His first Passover He had intimated that, as Moses lifted up the
serpent in the wilderness, so the Son of Man should be lifted up.
He used this expression "lifted up" three times, and an
Evangelist gives the explanation: "This he said, signifying what
death he should die."<a name="FNanchor086"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_086"><sup>[086]</sup></a> Again and again He told the
disciples that He had come to give His life a ransom for many,
that He was to be betrayed and killed, that as the Good Shepherd
He would give His life for the sheep.<a name="FNanchor087"></a><a
href="#Footnote_087"><sup>[087]</sup></a> He intimated that His
death was in accordance with the deliberate counsel and
foreknowledge of His Father, and with His own free and full
assent: "Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my
life."<a name="FNanchor088"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_088"><sup>[088]</sup></a> And when betrayal and
apprehension brought His ministry to a close, He would allow no
sword to be drawn in His defence, but was brought as a "lamb to
the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he
opened not his mouth."<a name="FNanchor089"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_089"><sup>[089]</sup></a></p>
<p>The views which the Jews entertained with regard to the
triumphant progress of Messiah did not accord with the statements
of their prophets. The sacred writers who foretold His coming
pointed indeed to victory as the ultimate issue of His mission,
but they also clearly associated His life with conflict and
suffering. From the first intimation of a Deliverer, which spoke
of a heel bruised by man's malignant adversary, there was
indicated in every type and prophecy the truth that Messiah was
to be "a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief," whose triumph
was to be achieved through suffering. The expectation current
among the Jews that deliverance would be wrought by Messiah,
without humiliation or suffering, showed that they misinterpreted
the messages of the prophets. Familiar with the letter, they
failed to grasp the spirit of the prophetical writings. Jesus
laid this ignorance to their charge when He said to them, "Ye do
err, not knowing the scriptures";<a name="FNanchor090"></a><a
href="#Footnote_090"><sup>[090]</sup></a> and He upbraided the
two disciples on the way to Emmaus because they had failed to
discover that their Redeemer's glory was to be won through
conflict: "O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the
prophets have spoken: ought not Christ to have suffered these
things, and to enter into His glory?"<a name="FNanchor091"></a><a
href="#Footnote_091"><sup>[091]</sup></a></p>
<p>The suffering which Jesus endured was both bodily and
spiritual. Persecution followed Him as a babe: Herod sought to
slay Him, and Joseph and Mary had to flee into Egypt.<a name=
"FNanchor092"></a><a href="#Footnote_092"><sup>[092]</sup></a> He
was "despised and rejected" by His countrymen. His claims were
refused by His kinsmen. He "endured the contradiction of
sinners."<a name="FNanchor093"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_093"><sup>[093]</sup></a> He "took our infirmities and
bare our sicknesses." He hungered and thirsted and was weary; He
was spit upon, buffeted, and scourged. The cross on which He was
to suffer was laid upon His shoulders, till His exhausted frame
broke down; and on Calvary a thorny crown was set upon His brow,
and the cruel nails pierced His hands and His feet. But the
sorrow within His soul was worse to bear than bodily buffering.
Travail of soul was the consummation of His afflictions, and
while we do not read of a groan wrung from Him by bodily torture,
soul-trouble led Him to ask His Father with "strong crying and
tears," as His frame was agonized and His sweat was like drops of
blood&mdash;"If it be possible, let this cup pass from me."<a
name="FNanchor094"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_094"><sup>[094]</sup></a> As man's Saviour Jesus was
made perfect through suffering.<a name="FNanchor095"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_095"><sup>[095]</sup></a> "We have not an high priest
which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but
was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin."<a
name="FNanchor096"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_096"><sup>[096]</sup></a> The world is full of
suffering, and He alone can understand and sympathise with it who
has experienced it. It is the knowledge that their Divine Saviour
is their Brother-man that gives to believing sufferers boldness
and confidence as they draw nigh to the throne of grace.</p>
<br>

<p>SECTION 2.&mdash;WAS CRUCIFIED</p>
<br>

<p>Prophecy in the sense of prediction is a very interesting and
important branch of Christian evidence. Old Testament prophets
foretold minute events in the history of the Lord Jesus Christ,
such as His lineal descent, the place and time of His birth, its
miraculous character, His death, His burial, His three days'
sojourn in the sepulchre, the casting of lots for His raiment,
the piercing of His hands and feet, His last exclamation, His
resurrection and ascension. Whatever view may be taken as to the
dates of the various books of Scripture, it must be admitted that
the whole body of the Old Testament was in circulation among the
Jews hundreds of years before the birth of Christ. There can be
no doubt that these prophecies were separated by great distance
in time from the events predicted. Even the Septuagint Version,
which is a Greek translation from the original Hebrew Scriptures,
existed at Alexandria about two hundred years before His
advent.</p>
<p>One of the most striking features of Old Testament prediction
is its bearing upon the closing scenes of Christ's history. In
its types as well as in its prophecies His death was
foreshadowed, and the humiliating and ignominious treatment to
which He was subjected minutely described. The predictions
involved events that appeared contradictory and paradoxical until
their fulfilment furnished the key. He Himself told the disciples
again and again that He should be crucified. This form of
execution was a Roman punishment reserved for slaves and the
vilest criminals; and the fact that Jesus was subjected to it
depended on a combination of events which no mere human sagacity
could have foreseen. It required that, though he should be
apprehended, accused, tried, and found guilty by Jews, His
death-sentence should be inflicted by Gentiles; that the Roman
governor of Judaea should, against his better judgment, surrender
to the clamorous cry of a mob who demanded that the prisoner
should be crucified. It required that the betrayal and
condemnation of Jesus should take place during the Passover week,
when it was unlawful for the Jews to put any man to death. The
excuse of the Jewish rulers, that they could not inflict death,
did not mean that this power had been withdrawn from them, but
that it was against their law to exercise it then. Had the season
been different, had the Jews themselves carried out the sentence
of death, it would have been accomplished not by crucifixion, but
by stoning. Such an execution would not have fulfilled prophecy
or have been associated with the ignominy that marked the Roman
death-penalty. Thus the Scripture was fulfilled in Him, "Cursed
is every one that hangeth on a tree."<a name="FNanchor097"></a><a
href="#Footnote_097"><sup>[097]</sup></a> There is but one
explanation that meets these facts, which is that they were
directed by the counsel and foreknowledge of God, and that holy
men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>The death of Jesus by crucifixion fulfilled in a wonderful
manner the types and figures of the Old Testament. He applied the
type of the brazen serpent to His death on the cross on which He
was to be lifted up, and from which He was to exercise His
healing power on those whom sin had bitten. The surrender of
Isaac by Abraham, when he that had received the promises offered
up his only begotten son, prefigured the unspeakable gift by the
Father, who spared not His own Son, and the self-surrender of the
Son, who gave Himself for us. As Isaac went forth bearing the
wood on which he was to be offered, he was a type of Him who went
forth from Jerusalem to Calvary bearing His cross. Had His
sentence been any other than death by crucifixion, He would not
have come under the doom which required that a prisoner should
bear his cross. The Paschal Lamb, of which not a bone was to be
broken, prefigured the Antitype in His exemption from the
treatment to which the two thieves crucified with Him were
subjected. In crucifixion He was numbered with the transgressors
and associated with accursed criminals, and so prophecy received
fulfilment.</p>
<p>It is a standing testimony at once to the reality of Christ's
suffering, and to the power which He exercises over men's minds
and consciences, that from being associated with shame and scorn,
the sign of the cross has been elevated to the highest place of
honour and dignity. Through his reverence for Jesus, Constantine
the Great, the first Christian Emperor of Rome, abolished
crucifixion. It is recognised that through Christ's death upon
the cross man obtains all that makes life precious. Instead of
being regarded with scorn, a cross is the coveted emblem now of
valour and exalted achievement. The instrument wherewith capital
punishment was inflicted on abandoned criminals has come to be an
ornament of monarchs. Such a change is to be explained only by
the fact that it is the sign of Christ's redeeming sacrifice, and
that to multitudes who glory in the Cross, He who suffered the
painful death on Calvary is the "power of God and the wisdom of
God unto salvation."</p>
<br>

<p>SECTION 3.&mdash;DEAD</p>
<br>

<p>The death of Jesus Christ was the result of His being
crucified. When He died, the great sacrifice for the sins of the
world was accomplished. Death was necessary for the completion of
His work, and this was the fact most prominent in Old Testament
type and prophecy. "Without shedding of blood is no remission,"<a
name="FNanchor098"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_098"><sup>[098]</sup></a> and it was to His death as
the procuring cause of salvation that the Apostles directed their
converts. To the Corinthians Paul wrote, "I delivered unto you
first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for
our sins according to the scriptures."<a name=
"FNanchor099"></a><a href="#Footnote_099"><sup>[099]</sup></a> It
was necessary that the lamb which formed the chief part of the
Passover meal should be slain, and so Messiah was brought as a
lamb to the slaughter, and when John saw Him in vision it was as
a Lamb that had been slain.<a name="FNanchor100"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_100"><sup>[100]</sup></a> It is the death of Jesus
that we commemorate in the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper. The
bread represents His body "broken for us"; the wine, His blood
which was "shed for many for the remission of sins."<a name=
"FNanchor101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101"><sup>[101]</sup></a>
"We are reconciled to God by the death of His Son."<a name=
"FNanchor102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102"><sup>[102]</sup></a>
"We have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of
sins."<a name="FNanchor103"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_103"><sup>[103]</sup></a> Statements such as these
fail to convey any meaning if Christ did not really die on the
cross, or if salvation comes to us in any other way than through
His death as an atoning sacrifice. Of the reality of the death
there is abundant evidence. It is recorded that, after six hours
of suffering on the cross, Jesus gave up the ghost. The soldiers
did not break His legs as they did in the case of the
malefactors, because they saw and pronounced Him dead already;
but one of them inflicted a spear-wound with a force that would
have caused death had any life remained. The result was an
outflow of blood and water, of itself sufficient evidence that
death had done its work upon the Sufferer. Before Pilate
permitted the body of Jesus to be delivered to Joseph, he was
careful to make sure, by questioning the centurion in charge,
that the wonderful prisoner who had caused him so great anxiety
was dead. Thus Messiah was cut off, but not for Himself. He stood
in the room and stead of sinners, and, though Himself without
sin, He tasted death for every man. "He was delivered for our
offences." "The Lord laid on him the iniquity of us all." His
death was not the result of unavoidable circumstances, for it
pleased the Lord to bruise Him; and His sacrifice was voluntary,
for He said, "I lay down my life ... no man taketh it from me."<a
name="FNanchor104"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_104"><sup>[104]</sup></a> The penalty of death which
He endured did not pertain to Him but to those for whom He died.
"He bore our sins in his own body on the tree."<a name=
"FNanchor105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105"><sup>[105]</sup></a> We
are "justified by his blood."<a name="FNanchor106"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_106"><sup>[106]</sup></a> "God hath set him forth to
be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his
righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through
the forbearance of God ... that he might be just, and the
justifier of him that believeth in Jesus."<a name=
"FNanchor107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107"><sup>[107]</sup></a>
"Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to
condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift
came upon all men to justification of life. For as by one man's
disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one
shall many be made righteous."<a name="FNanchor108"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_108"><sup>[108]</sup></a></p>
<p>In the statement that Jesus Christ "was dead," the Creed
affirms the reality of Christ's death in opposition to certain
early heretics, the Docetae, who said that His death was not real
but only apparent. A similar view has been adopted by some modern
writers, who assert that what the witnesses of the crucifixion
saw was not death but a swoon, from which, through the ministry
of His disciples, Jesus was restored after He had been taken down
from the cross. It is urged in support of this view that a
crucified criminal did not usually die as Jesus is said to have
died, six hours after He was crucified, but lingered on for days,
before being relieved from his sufferings by death. Jesus' legs
were not broken by the soldiers, because they believed Him to be
dead, but&mdash;say those who deny the reality of the
death&mdash;the soldiers were mistaken, the seeming lifelessness
was not real, and recovery soon followed, so complete that He was
able to appear in public on the third day.</p>
<p>In considering this statement, we must take into account the
physical condition of Jesus when He was crucified. On the night
of His betrayal, and after His apprehension, He had been
subjected to intense suffering in body and to sorrow of soul such
as human thought cannot conceive. In Gethsemane He had passed
through an experience of agony from which He must have risen
weakened, to endure new forms of suffering. He had been scourged
by Roman soldiers, whose cruel loaded weapons inflicted wounds
that left deep scars upon His flesh and caused intense pain and
exhaustion. His hands and feet had been fixed to the cross with
nails. He had been crowned with thorns and mocked and hooted by a
reckless mob. He had been hurried from the Sanhedrim to the
Judgment-hall, and had carried the cross until He sank beneath
its weight. He had for six hours endured intense suffering from
pain and thirst, and when, after a strong Roman soldier had
thrust a spear into His side, He was taken down from the cross,
and declared by the centurion and his company to be dead, He was
laid without food, and remained for two nights and a day, in a
cold rock-sepulchre, whose door was barred by a great stone,
sealed, and guarded by soldiers. Suppose for a moment that Jesus
had survived this terrible ordeal of suffering, and that, having
eluded His Roman guard and His Jewish persecutors, He had again
entered into Jerusalem, it must have been as a weak, disabled
invalid, not as a man possessing normal strength and vigour. Yet
on the third day He showed Himself alive, bearing no traces of
the suffering He had endured except the marks of His wounds. The
feet that had been pierced bore Him from Jerusalem to Emmaus, a
journey of threescore furlongs; and He passed from place to place
with a swiftness of movement and a superiority to obstacles that
filled the disciples with amazement.</p>
<p>In the light of these facts, the view we have been considering
is utterly untenable. It is no matter for wonder that Jesus,
after such exhaustion, died six hours after He had been lifted up
on the cross. The circumstances which preceded His dying are not
consistent with the opinion that while in the sepulchre He
recovered from a swoon. It is not possible to conceive that a
man, wounded and bruised&mdash;His hands, feet, and side pierced
with nails and spear&mdash;could appear so soon, bright and
radiant, strong and vigorous, undistressed by pain or weakness,
and possessing power of movement not only restored, but
marvellously augmented. If Jesus was not really "dead," no
explanation can be given of His disappearance from history. If He
had really lived as a man after His crucifixion, we should have
looked for a fresh outbreak of persecution directed against Him.
We have His own testimony by the Spirit, "I am he that liveth,
and was dead."<a name="FNanchor109"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_109"><sup>[109]</sup></a></p>
<br>

<p>SECTION 4.&mdash;AND BURIED</p>
<br>

<p>Isaiah thus prophesied regarding the burial of the Messiah:
"He was cut off out of the land of the living ... and he made his
grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death."<a name=
"FNanchor110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110"><sup>[110]</sup></a> In
ordinary circumstances, the body of a crucified person would not
have received burial. It was the Roman custom to leave the bodies
of slaves and criminals, who alone were subjected to this
punishment, suspended on the cross, a prey to beasts and birds,
and when these and the elements had done their work upon the
flesh, the remains were ignominiously cast out. The Jews, who
inflicted capital punishment not by crucifixion but by stoning,
did not thus deal with the bodies of malefactors; but, as the law
directed, gave them burial on the night of execution.<a name=
"FNanchor111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111"><sup>[111]</sup></a>
The presence of dead bodies in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem
during the Passover festival was regarded as a defilement, and
steps were taken to have those of Jesus and the malefactors
removed. The Jews could not themselves dispose of the bodies,
because they would have sustained pollution by contact with them,
and also because they had made over to the Romans the execution
of the death-sentence. "The Jews therefore, because it was the
preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on
the Sabbath day, (for that Sabbath day was an high day,) besought
Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be
taken away."<a name="FNanchor112"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_112"><sup>[112]</sup></a> This request was granted,
but, through the interposition of Joseph, a rich man of
Arimathaea&mdash;to whom, as a member of the supreme council, the
resolution for the removal of the bodies would be
known&mdash;that of Jesus escaped the ignominious treatment to
which the others were subjected. He came and went in boldly unto
Pilate and craved the body of Jesus, securing for it an
honourable burial such as the Jews had not contemplated. Pilate
"gave" the body to Joseph, and he bought fine linen, and took Him
down and wrapped Him in the linen and laid Him in a sepulchre,
which was hewn out of a rock.<a name="FNanchor113"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_113"><sup>[113]</sup></a></p>
<p>It was a new sepulchre, "where never man had yet lain."<a
name="FNanchor114"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_114"><sup>[114]</sup></a> In Joseph's holy task there
was associated with him Nicodemus, who brought costly spices
wherewith to embalm the body, "as the manner of the Jews is to
bury." The disciples of Jesus do not appear to have shared in
this work, which was watched from a distance by certain women
from Galilee, who followed and saw where He was laid. They, too,
made ready spices and ointment with which to honour the body of
the Lord; but when they came to the tomb on the morning of the
first day of the week, they found it empty, for Jesus had risen.
It is not without meaning that the tomb in which the body of
Jesus was laid was a new one. It was thus impossible to affirm
that any other than He had opened a way out of its dark recess,
the conqueror of death.</p>
<p>Such was the wonderful combination of circumstances that led
to the fulfilment of Isaiah's prophecy, "He made his grave with
the wicked, and with the rich in his death." The Jews desired
that He should be buried with the wicked. When they besought
Pilate to remove the bodies, they wished that Jesus and the
malefactors should be laid together. If the Jewish rulers had not
parted with their right to dispose of the bodies, the three who
had been crucified together would have been consigned to the
burying-ground set apart for the interment of Jewish criminals;
but it was the Divine decree that Jesus should make His grave
with the rich, and therefore the event was so overruled that the
bodies of Jesus and the malefactors were at the disposal not of
the Jews, but of the Roman governor, who delivered the body of
Jesus to the rich Joseph. While, therefore, Jesus was executed in
such a way that, but for the intervention of the Jews and Pilate
and Joseph, He would have been buried with criminals, "he made
his grave with the rich in his death." Thus He who had humbled
Himself in dying was honoured in His burial. Joseph and Nicodemus
were timid men. The one was a secret disciple and the other,
through fear of the Jews, came to Jesus by night. Though members
of the Sanhedrim, they had lacked courage to defend Jesus when He
was under trial; but now, grown bold, they identified themselves
with Him.</p>
<p>The sepulchre was carefully watched. The Jews, thinking that
they might hear something about the resurrection of Him whom they
called "that deceiver," went to Pilate and made known their fear
that the disciples would steal His body and say that He had risen
from the dead.<a name="FNanchor115"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_115"><sup>[115]</sup></a> The Roman governor made
light of their apprehension, and said to them, perhaps
sarcastically, "Ye have a watch: make it as sure as ye can." "So
they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and
setting a watch,"<a name="FNanchor116"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_116"><sup>[116]</sup></a>&mdash;proceedings which
eventually furnished strong confirmation of the reality of
Christ's death, burial, and resurrection.</p>

<p><i>He descended into hell; the third day He rose again from
the dead</i></p>
<p>SECTION 1.&mdash;HE DESCENDED INTO HELL</p>
<br>

<p>It is somewhat startling to find in the Creed this statement
regarding our Lord, "He descended into hell." The clause, which
was one of the latest admitted into the Creed, was derived from
another creed known as that of Aquileia, compiled in the fourth
century. It does not appear in the Nicene Creed, but it has a
place in the Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England, where
we read, "As Christ died for us, and was buried, so also it is to
be believed that He went down into Hell." The Westminster
Divines, who gave the Creed a place at the close of their Shorter
Catechism, appended a note explanatory of the clause to this
effect, "That is, continued in the state of the dead, and under
the power of death, until the third day."</p>
<p>The word "hell" is used in various senses in the Old
Testament. Sometimes it means the grave, sometimes the abode of
departed spirits irrespective of character, sometimes the place
in which the wicked are punished.</p>
<p>In the English New Testament, also, the word "hell" has not in
every place the same meaning. It represents two different nouns
in the original Greek&mdash;Gehenna and Hades. <i>Gehenna</i> was
the name of a deep, narrow valley, bordered by precipitous rocks,
in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem, which had been desecrated by
human sacrifices in the time of idolatrous kings, and afterwards
became the depository of city refuse and of the offal of the
temple sacrifices. The other noun, rendered by the same English
word <i>Hell</i>, is <i>Hades</i>, which means "covered,"
"unseen" or "hidden." <i>Hades</i> is the abode of disembodied
spirits until the resurrection. The Jews believed it to consist
of two parts, one blissful, which they termed
<i>Paradise</i>&mdash;the abode of the faithful; the other
<i>Gehenna</i>, in which the wicked are retained for judgment.
Lazarus and Dives were both in Hades, but separated from each
other by an impassable gulf, the one in an abode of comfort, the
other in a place of torment.<a name="FNanchor117"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_117"><sup>[117]</sup></a></p>
<p>As long as the spirit tabernacles in the body there are tokens
of its presence in the visible life which is sustained through
its union with the body. But when it departs from its
dwelling-place in the flesh, death and corruption begin their
work on the body. Death is complete only when the spirit has
departed, and it is probable that this statement in the Creed was
meant to express in the fullest terms that Christ's death was
real. As man He had taken to Himself a true body and a reasonable
soul, and when His body was crucified and dead, His spirit
passed, as other human spirits pass at death, into Hades. It is
not without a meaning that we read, "When Jesus had cried with a
loud voice, he gave up the ghost."<a name="FNanchor118"></a><a
href="#Footnote_118"><sup>[118]</sup></a> Ghost is simply spirit,
and in His case, as in that of every man, there was a true
departure of the soul from the body at death. It was with His
spirit that His last thought in life was occupied. He knew that
though it was to depart from the battered, bruised tabernacle of
His body, it was not to pass out of His Father's sight or His
Father's care. "Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit,"<a
name="FNanchor119"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_119"><sup>[119]</sup></a> were His last words on the
cross.</p>
<p>The descent into hell is not referred to in the Westminster
Confession, but in the Larger Catechism this statement is found:
"Christ's humiliation after His death consisted in His being
buried, and continuing in the state of the dead, and under the
power of death, till the third day, which hath been otherwise
expressed in these words, 'He descended into hell'"<a name=
"FNanchor120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120"><sup>[120]</sup></a>
What the Westminster Divines meant was, that while Christ's body
was laid in the grave His spirit passed from the visible to the
invisible world, that, as He shared the common lot of men in the
death and burial of His body, so He shared their common lot in
passing as a spirit into the abode of spirits. The statement of
this clause follows naturally what is said of the body of Jesus
in that which precedes it. As His body was crucified, dead, and
buried, so His spirit passed into the abode of spirits. "In all
things it behoved him to be made like unto His brethren."<a name=
"FNanchor121"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_121"><sup>[121]</sup></a></p>
<p>Those who maintain that the spirit of Christ descended into
hell in a sense peculiar to Himself, ground their opinion upon
certain passages of Scripture. Psalm xvi. 10&mdash;"Thou wilt not
leave my soul in hell, nor wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see
corruption"&mdash;is quoted in support of this opinion, but does
not really justify it. It expresses the confidence of the
speaker, that God will not deliver His soul to the power of Sheol
(the Hebrew word equivalent to the Greek Hades), or suffer His
body to see corruption, and in this sense the passage is quoted
by Peter, as a proof from prophecy of the resurrection of Christ.
Ephesians iv. 9 is also regarded as giving sanction to this
view&mdash;"Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also
descended first into the lower parts of the earth?" By the "lower
parts of the earth" some understand parts lower than the earth,
but such a view rests on a strained interpretation of the
passage. Paul's argument is that ascent to heaven must have been
made by one who, before ascending, was below. Christ had come
down from heaven to earth, and was below therefore, he argues,
Christ is the subject of the prophecy he has quoted. He it was
that hid ascended up on high, not the Father, who is
everywhere.<a name="FNanchor122"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_122"><sup>[122]</sup></a></p>
<p>In Isaiah xliv. 23 we have corroboration of this view: "Sing, O
ye heavens ... shout, ye lower parts of the earth." Here "lower
parts" means simply the earth beneath; that is, beneath the
heavens.</p>
<p>The most difficult and important passage bearing on the clause
is 1 Peter iii. 18, 19. "Being put to death in the flesh, but
quickened by the spirit by which also he went and preached to the
spirits in prison." In the Revised Version the rendering is not
"by" but "in," "which" referring to the word "spirit,"&mdash;not
the third Person of the Godhead, but the human spirit of
Jesus&mdash;in which spirit, separated from the body yet instinct
with immortal life, He went and "preached to the spirits in
prison," or rather to the spirits in custody. The passage marks
an antithesis between "flesh" and "spirit." In Christ's "flesh."
He was put to death. His enemies killed His body, but His soul
was as beyond their power. His body was dead, but in the abode of
souls His "spirit" was alive and active.</p>
<p>So far there is here simply the statement that our Lord's
disembodied spirit passed to Hades, but the Apostle adds that He
"preached to the spirits in prison," and it is inferred by some
that He preached repentance, but this is an assumption for which
there is no Scripture warrant. We are not told what was the
subject of Christ's preaching. He had finished His work on earth,
had atoned for sin, had overcome death and conquered Satan. Even
angels did not fully know the work of grace and salvation which
Christ accomplished for man, and it is not likely that the
spirits of departed antediluvians and patriarchs understood its
greatness. The least in the Kingdom of Heaven knows more than the
greatest of patriarchs or prophets knew. While in the flesh they
had seen His day afar off, and, as disembodied spirits, they knew
that Messiah by suffering and dying was to work out their
redemption, but before the work was finished neither men nor
angels understood the mystery of it, and what is more likely than
that the completion of His redeeming work was first made known to
them in the spirit by the Redeemer Himself? If we accept this
view, the preaching to the spirits in prison was the intimation
to those already blessed, who had while on earth repented and
believed, that Messiah by dying had brought in everlasting
salvation for His people.</p>
<p>There is still a difficulty in Peter's words. Christ is said
to have preached to those who were disobedient in the days of
Noah. Peter says that in the writings of Paul there are some
things hard to be understood, but what he himself writes
regarding Christ's work in Hades is also difficult, and the
passage has found a great variety of interpretations. It would
seem to imply that Christ in the spirit carried a special message
to the antediluvians who had been disobedient and had perished in
the Flood. What that message was we are not told, and human
conjecture may not supply what the Spirit of God has seen fit to
conceal. While the passage is a difficult one, the inference is
not warranted which some have drawn from it, that those who are
disobedient to Christ and reject His Gospel may, though they die
impenitent, nevertheless obtain salvation after death. The plain
teaching of Scripture is that it is appointed unto men once to
die, and after that the judgment.<a name="FNanchor123"></a><a
href="#Footnote_123"><sup>[123]</sup></a> And whatever the
statement of Peter may mean, it does not sanction belief in
purgatory or in universal restoration. Romanists teach that the
department of Hades to which the spirit of our Lord descended was
that in which dwelt the souls of believers who died before the
time of Christ, and that the object of His descent was the
deliverance and introduction into heaven of the pious dead who
had been imprisoned in the <i>Limbus Patrum</i>, as they term
that portion of Hades which these occupied. This they say was the
triumph of Christ to which Paul refers in Ephesians iv. 8, when,
quoting the 68th Psalm, he tells us that He ascended up on high,
leading captivity captive.</p>
<p>According to the Romanists, Hades consists of three
divisions&mdash;heaven, hell, and purgatory. Heaven is the most
blessed abode reserved for three classes of persons:&mdash;1st,
Those Old Testament saints whose spirits were detained in custody
until Christ arose, when they were led out by Him in triumph;
2nd, Those who in this life attain to perfection in holiness; and
3rd, Those believers in Christ, who, having died in a state of
imperfection, have made satisfaction for their sins and receive
cleansing through endurance of the fires of purgatory. Hell is
the abode of endless torment, where heretics and all who die in
mortal sin suffer eternally. Purgatory is supposed to complete
the atonement of Christ. His work delivers from original sin and
eternal punishment, but satisfaction for actual transgression is
not complete until after the endurance of temporal punishments
and the pains of purgatory. The Church of Rome claims the right
to prescribe the nature and extent of such punishments, and
having devised a complicated system of indulgences, penances, and
masses, professes to hold the Keys of Heaven and to possess
authority to regulate penalties and obtain pardon for the living
and the dead. Such claims are unfounded and false. God alone can
forgive sin, and He recognises only two classes&mdash;the
righteous and the wicked&mdash;here and hereafter; and only two
everlasting dwelling-places&mdash;heaven and hell. The Romanist
doctrine has no authority in Scripture, but is of heathen origin,
being derived from the Egyptians through the Greeks and Romans,
and having been current throughout the Roman Empire. Its effect
has been the aggrandisement and enrichment of the papal
priesthood and the subjection of the people. It contradicts the
Word of God, which declares that there is no condemnation to the
believer in Christ Jesus; that he hath eternal life; that for him
to depart is to be with Christ, to enjoy unalloyed, unending
blessedness. Protestants, therefore, hold that "the souls of
believers are at their death made perfect in holiness, and do
immediately pass into glory."<a name="FNanchor124"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_124"><sup>[124]</sup></a></p>
<p>Between those who hold the doctrine of purgatory and believers
in universal restoration, there is not a little in common.
Universalists reject the Atonement, and say that God always
punishes men for their sins. The wicked must expect to suffer in
the next world, but the mercy of God will follow them, the
punishment endured will in time effect deliverance, and the
result will finally be the restoration of all to purity and
happiness. They thus maintain with regard to all, what Romanists
hold respecting those who pass to purgatory, and both are to be
answered in the same way. We cannot make satisfaction, and we
need not, for Jesus has borne "our sins in his own body on the
tree."<a name="FNanchor125"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_125"><sup>[125]</sup></a> By this "one offering he
hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified"; so that "there
remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful
looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour
the adversaries."<a name="FNanchor126"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_126"><sup>[126]</sup></a></p>
<p>This clause has place in the Creed as a protest against the
heresy of Apollinaris, a Bishop of Laodicea, who taught that
Christ did not assume a human soul when He became incarnate. He
thus denied the perfect manhood of Christ, and in support of His
doctrine appealed to the fact that the Scripture says,<a name=
"FNanchor127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127"><sup>[127]</sup></a>
"The Word (in Greek, Logos) was made flesh," "God was manifest in
the flesh," while it is never said that He was made spirit. He
sought to establish a connection between the Divine Logos and
human flesh of such a kind that all the attributes of God passed
into the human nature and all the human attributes into the
Divine, while both together merged in one nature in Christ, who,
being neither man nor God, but a mixture of God and man, held a
middle place. His heresy found many supporters, though it was
promptly met by Gregory Nazianzen, who showed that the term
"flesh" is used in Scripture to denote the whole human nature,
and that when Christ became incarnate He took upon Him the
complete nature of humanity, untainted by sin. Only thus could He
be qualified to become man's Saviour, for only a perfect man can
be a full and complete Redeemer. Man's spirit, his most noble
element, stands in need of redemption as well as his body, for
all its faculties are corrupted by sin.</p>
<p>In affirming that Jesus descended into hell, this clause of
the Creed declares that He possessed the complete nature of
humanity; that His true body died, and that His reasonable soul
departed to Hades.</p>

<p>SECTION 2.&mdash;THE THIRD DAY HE ROSE AGAIN FROM THE DEAD<a
name="FNanchor128"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_128"><sup>[128]</sup></a></p>
<br>

<p>On the morning of the first day of the week, thenceforth
hallowed as the Lord's Day&mdash;the Christian Sabbath&mdash;the
soul of Jesus left Hades, and once more and for ever entered the
body, and formed with it the perfected humanity of the "Word made
flesh." The resurrection of Jesus is a well-attested fact of
history. The close-sealed, sentinelled sepulchre, the broken
seal, the stone rolled away, the trembling guard, the empty tomb,
and the many appearances of Jesus to the women, the disciples,
the brethren, and last of all to Saul of Tarsus, prove that He
had risen.<a name="FNanchor129"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_129"><sup>[129]</sup></a></p>
<p>The Resurrection was a fulfilment of Old Testament prophecy.
Peter thus interprets Psalm xvi. 10, "For thou wilt not leave my
soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see
corruption," affirming that David in that Psalm speaks of the
Resurrection of Christ.<a name="FNanchor130"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_130"><sup>[130]</sup></a> Jesus Himself often
foretold, both figuratively and directly, His own resurrection,
as when He spoke of the coming destruction of the Temple, and
connected it with the death and resurrection of His body;<a name=
"FNanchor131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131"><sup>[131]</sup></a> or
when He told the disciples that in a little while they should not
see Him, and again in a little while they should see Him.<a name=
"FNanchor132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132"><sup>[132]</sup></a>
The place which this doctrine holds in the Christian faith is
shown by the numerous references to it in the Epistles.</p>
<p>The Apostles had not grasped the statements of Christ in such
a way as to lead them to look with confidence for His return, or
to gather hope of His resurrection. On the contrary, they did not
expect His resurrection, and, when they heard of it, they could
not believe it to be real.<a name="FNanchor133"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_133"><sup>[133]</sup></a> Yet, convinced by the
evidence of their own senses, they came to hold it fast as the
fact that crowned all their hopes in life and death. Although the
preaching of "Jesus and the Resurrection" exposed them to
persecution and martyrdom, they nevertheless continued to
proclaim a risen Lord. "If Christ is not risen," says Paul, "then
is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain,"<a name=
"FNanchor134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134"><sup>[134]</sup></a>
and he goes on to admit that if the Resurrection had not taken
place, he was altogether mistaken in the view of God's character
set forth in his preaching and epistles. Peter makes a similar
statement: "We are begotten again unto a lively hope by the
resurrection of Jesus Christ."<a name="FNanchor135"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_135"><sup>[135]</sup></a> It is His victory over death
that confirms the truth of His claims. He is proved to be the Son
of God by His resurrection from the dead.<a name=
"FNanchor136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136"><sup>[136]</sup></a> So
important a fact was it regarded in connection with their work,
that when they met to select a successor to Judas in the
apostolic college, it was held to be essential that no one should
be appointed who was not able to testify that he had seen the
risen Lord.<a name="FNanchor137"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_137"><sup>[137]</sup></a> Paul regarded this doctrine
as so necessary, that he made it the basis of faith and
salvation: "If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus,
and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from
the dead, thou shalt be saved."<a name="FNanchor138"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_138"><sup>[138]</sup></a></p>
<p>The life of Paul is an unanswerable argument for the truth of
the Resurrection. Not only did he preach this as the central
doctrine of Christianity; he maintained it at the cost of all
that, before his conversion, he had held dear. He was not a man
to give his faith to such a doctrine without overwhelming
evidence of its truth. As Saul of Tarsus he had been in the
fullest confidence of the Jewish rulers, and knew all that they
could urge against the reality of the Resurrection, but their
arguments had no weight with one who had seen the risen Lord on
the way to Damascus.</p>
<p>The importance of the Resurrection of Christ as an argument
for the Divine origin of Christianity is recognised alike by
those who receive and by those who reject it. Negative criticism
has assailed the doctrine and has devised ingenious theories to
explain on natural grounds the testimony on which it is received.
The diversity of such explanations goes far to refute them, and
their utter failure to account for the marvellous effects which
the appearances of the risen Jesus produced on the witnesses, or
for the place which the doctrine held in their teaching, has
tended rather to establish than to discredit the reality of the
Resurrection.</p>
<p>Various sceptical theories, to which much importance was
attached for a time, are now almost forgotten. The Mythical
theory fails to account for the immediate effect produced by
belief in the Resurrection. Myths require time for their growth
and development, but the disciples of Jesus set the Resurrection
in the forefront from the very first. On the day of Pentecost
Peter sounded the keynote of Apostolic preaching when he
declared, "This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are
witnesses." And so from this time forward, "with great power gave
the Apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus." The
historical fact not only rests upon the most irresistible
evidence; it is the very corner-stone of the whole fabric of
Gospel teaching.</p>
<p>Another view of the testimony for the Resurrection has found
advocates who claim that it explains, without having recourse to
supernaturalism, the belief of the disciples and others in the
doctrine. With some minor differences of detail, they agree in
attributing the persistency of those who said that they had seen
Jesus alive, to the impression produced on them by His wonderful
personality. This, they hold, was so strong that the effect
continued after His death, and the disciples saw visions of Him
so vivid that they believed them to be real appearances. He had
filled so much of their lives while He was with them, that they
were unable to realise His departure, and retained His image in
their hearts continually. Exalted and excited feeling projected
His figure so that they saw Him apparently restored to life.</p>
<p>A theory such as this will not stand, in the face of the
evidence for the Resurrection. It was no subjective impression,
but the Saviour Himself, that brought conviction to the minds of
the numerous witnesses. It was no apparition, it was a body that
they saw and handled and tested and proved to be of flesh and
blood. They heard their Master speak, and saw Him eat; and at
frequent intervals for forty days He showed Himself to them.
Sometimes He was seen by one, sometimes by many; and before His
ascension He charged them to carry on the work He had committed
to them: to feed His sheep, to feed His lambs, to go into all the
world and preach the Gospel to every creature. "Him," said Peter,
"God raised up on the third day, and showed him openly; not to
all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to
us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the
dead."<a name="FNanchor139"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_139"><sup>[139]</sup></a></p>
<p>What they saw was the true body of their Lord, the same that
had been crucified, dead, and buried, but a marvellous change had
passed over it. It was now possessed of spiritual qualities,
suddenly appearing, suddenly vanishing; now felt to be made of
flesh and bones, and now passing through closed doors, or walking
upon water. It was no longer subject to natural law as it had
been before the Resurrection; and when the disciples beheld the
Lord, they had not only proof of His continued existence, of His
being God as well as man, and of God's seal having been set upon
His atoning work,&mdash;they had also an intimation of what life
hereafter will be for His followers, who shall be like Him, for
they shall see Him as He is.</p>
<p>How full and widespread was the belief in the Resurrection of
Jesus in the hearts of those who were its witnesses, is apparent
not only from the fact that the great theme of their preaching
was "Jesus and the resurrection," but is also evident from the
importance they attached to the Lord's Day and the Lord's Supper.
These institutions have a direct connection with the
Resurrection, the former having been substituted for the Jewish
Sabbath expressly on the ground that on that day the Lord rose;
the latter, while it commemorates His death, sets forth also His
resurrection life.</p>

<p>Forty days after His resurrection Jesus charged the Apostles,
in the last words He is known to have spoken on earth, to testify
of Him throughout the world, and assured them that they should
receive power through the descent of the Holy Spirit. This
last-recorded utterance called His Church to missionary
enterprise: "Ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and

earth."<a name="FNanchor140"></a><a href=

<p>We are told that, when Jesus had spoken these things, "He led

<p>Ascension is the completion of Resurrection. "If he were on

"#Footnote_143"><sup>[143]</sup></a> No part of His work would
have corresponded to that of the high priest, who, when he had
offered up sacrifice, passed into the holy place with the blood
of the victim, and laid it upon the altar. The act thus
foreshadowed in the type was accomplished when our great High
Priest passed into the heavens, and "entered not into the holy

That they might be witnesses of the fact, it was necessary that
they should see Him go up from earth. Unlike the Ascension, the
Resurrection of Christ took place unseen by mortal eye.
Eye-witnesses of His rising from the dead were not needed. The
fact that they had seen Jesus after He rose qualified them to be
witnesses of His Resurrection, but it was only because they had
seen Him taken up that they could bear personal testimony to His
Ascension.</p>
<p>Thus our Lord "ascended into heaven, and sitteth on the right
hand of God the Father Almighty." This Article expresses the
honour and dignity of His Person and character. To sit on the
right hand is an honour reserved for the most favoured.<a name=
"FNanchor146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146"><sup>[146]</sup></a>
When the Scriptures speak of the right hand of God, it is meant
that, as the right hand among men is the place of honour, power,
and happiness, so to sit on the right hand of God is to obtain
the place of highest glory, power, and satisfaction.</p>
<p>At God's right hand our Lord entered into everlasting and
perfect glory and dominion. Being one with the Father, all that
is the Father's is His. He is exalted a Prince and a Saviour,
having an eternal life and all the fulness of the Godhead
dwelling in Him bodily. The Father Himself gave Him the place at
His right hand, having highly exalted Him and given Him a name
which is above every name. None can dethrone Him or successfully
plot against His kingdom. No weapon, carnal or spiritual, can
ever prevail against Him. It is this that gives to Christianity
its stability and power, for Christianity is Christ Himself
sitting at the right hand of God. The ascended Christ exercises
absolute authority and unlimited dominion. The Father on whose
right hand the Son sits is, in this clause, as in that which
stands at the beginning of the Creed, termed the "Father
Almighty." Though the distinction is not apparent in the English
version of the Creed, "Almighty" in the original Greek is in
these clauses expressed by two different words. In the earlier
clause, the word so rendered signifies God's supreme, universal
dominion, while here the word employed denotes the fact that His
power and operation are always efficacious and irresistible, and
that all things are under His absolute control. This word
"Almighty" warrants the belief which the clause declares, that
the Son, sitting on the right hand of the Father, possesses
absolute and universal power, and that in executing His office as
Mediator none can resist or oppose Him.</p>
<p>The word "sitteth" is expressive not so much of the attitude
as of the settled and continuous character of Christ's
exaltation. At God's right hand in heaven He executes the offices
of Prophet, Priest, and King, as He did on earth. The prophet, as
teacher of the revealed truth, held office in Old Testament
times; and when Jesus entered on His public ministry, it was as a
Divinely-accredited teacher that He claimed to be received. He
brought out of His treasury things new and old, and exhorted men
to hear, believe, and obey Him. By His words and His life, He
made known the will of God for man's salvation; and when He was
lifted up upon the cross, it was to the end that, by the
sacrifice He offered and the truth He taught, He might draw all
men unto Him. He brought life and immortality to light, and since
His departure He has not ceased to be the Teacher and the Guide
of all who receive Him. His word abides with us, and His first
gift to the Church after He rose was the Holy Ghost, who came to
lead men to all truth. When the Lord ascended on high He received
gifts for men, "and he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets;
and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; for the
perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the
edifying of the body of Christ."<a name="FNanchor147"></a><a
href="#Footnote_147"><sup>[147]</sup></a> It is in Him that all
Christian teaching originates, and through His Spirit that it
takes hold of men's hearts. Our Lord does not indeed now appear
in visible form, speaking face to face with men as He did in
Palestine, but He speaks in and through every believer who in His
name seeks to win souls for His Kingdom. Paul recognised this
when he wrote to the Corinthians, "Now then we are ambassadors
for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in
Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God."<a name=
"FNanchor148"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_148"><sup>[148]</sup></a></p>
<p>In His exaltation, Christ executes the office of a Priest. The
functions of the Jewish high priest were not limited to the
offering of sacrifice. When he had made an end of offering, he
carried the blood of the victim into the Holy Place and made
intercession for the sins of the congregation. As the mediator
between God and His people, he thus foreshadowed the work of Him
who is a "priest for ever, after the order of
Melchizedek,"&mdash;succeeding none, and being succeeded by none,
in His priestly office. As the high priest's work was partly
without and partly within the Holy Place, so Christ's priestly
work is twofold, consisting of His satisfaction for sin upon
earth and His intercession in heaven. "Christ our Passover is
sacrificed for us." He was once offered to bear the sins of many,
thereby satisfying Divine justice and reconciling men to God.
After having as our great High Priest offered the sacrifice of
Himself, He passed into the heavens. There He makes continual
intercession for us.</p>
<p>At the right hand of God He exercises kingly prerogatives
also. He was anointed to the royal office at His baptism, when
the Holy Ghost descended on Him.<a name="FNanchor149"></a><a
href="#Footnote_149"><sup>[149]</sup></a> When by death He
overcame him who had the power of death; when He rose from the
grave and announced to His disciples that all power was given Him
in heaven and earth, He asserted His kingly office; and when God,
having raised Him from the dead, set Him at His own right hand in
heavenly places, far above all principalities, and powers, and
might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in
this world, but also in that which is to come, all things were
put under His feet, He was given to be Head over all things to
the church,<a name="FNanchor150"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_150"><sup>[150]</sup></a> and received dominion and
glory and a kingdom. He must reign until all His enemies are
under His feet. "To which of the angels said he at any time, Sit
on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?"<a

<p><i>From thence He shall come to judge the quick and the
dead</i></p>
<br>

<p>This clause of the Creed points to the future. As those who
saw Jesus ascend stood gazing up, two heavenly messengers in
white apparel appeared and said to them, "This same Jesus, which
is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as
ye have seen him go into heaven."<a name="FNanchor152"></a><a
href="#Footnote_152"><sup>[152]</sup></a> Jesus Himself often
warned the disciples that the time was at hand when He should
leave them and return to His Father, but that His departure was
not to be final, for He would come again to gather all nations
before Him, and to judge the quick and the dead. He comforted
them by the statement that His going away was expedient for them.
"I go to prepare a place for you." "I will come again, and
receive you unto myself."<a name="FNanchor153"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_153"><sup>[153]</sup></a> But the return was not to be
only for the reception of the faithful into His kingdom and
glory, but for judgment upon all mankind. "The Son of man shall
come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then shall
he reward every man according to his works."<a name=
"FNanchor154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154"><sup>[154]</sup></a>
"Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and
they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall
wail because of him."<a name="FNanchor155"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_155"><sup>[155]</sup></a></p>
<p>The time of Christ's return to judgment has not been revealed.
"Of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of
heaven, but my Father only."<a name="FNanchor156"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_156"><sup>[156]</sup></a> The first Christians looked
for it with joyous expectation, believing that their Lord and
Master would speedily appear and redress their wrongs. Cruelly
persecuted by Jew and Gentile, it is no wonder that Apostles and
other believers associated the second advent with emancipation
and victory, and termed it "That blessed hope, the glorious
appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ."<a name=
"FNanchor157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157"><sup>[157]</sup></a>
Under the influence of false teachers, this expectation gave rise
to unhealthy excitement and consequent disorder in the Church. In
his second Epistle to the Thessalonians Paul set himself
earnestly to counteract their teaching. He indignantly repudiated
the doctrine attributed to him, apparently in connection with a
forged epistle, and he supplied a test by which the genuineness
of his letters might be proved.</p>
<p>The mistake of the Thessalonians has often been repeated.
Attempts have been made to fix the time of the Lord's second
coming, and the work of predicting goes on busily still.
Enthusiasts and impostors have been more or less successful in
finding credulous followers. Again and again the progress of time
has falsified such predictions, but would-be prophets have not
been discouraged by the blunders of their predecessors.</p>
<p>All men, quick and dead, are to be brought before the
Judgment-seat, the faithful that they may be raised to
everlasting blessedness, and the wicked to be dismissed to
everlasting punishment. Paul describes the events of the great
day of Christ's appearing as it will affect the saints. "The Lord
himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of
the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ
shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be
caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in
the air."<a name="FNanchor158"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_158"><sup>[158]</sup></a> He gives a similar
description to the Corinthians: "We shall not all sleep, but we
shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at
the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall
be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed."<a name=
"FNanchor159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159"><sup>[159]</sup></a>
"He commanded us to testify," says Peter, "that it is he which
was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead."<a name=
"FNanchor160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160"><sup>[160]</sup></a>
And Paul writes to Timothy that "the Lord Jesus Christ shall
judge the quick and the dead at his appearing."<a name=
"FNanchor161"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_161"><sup>[161]</sup></a></p>
<p>The most awful descriptions of the Judgment, as it will affect
the wicked, are given by the Lord Jesus Himself. In Matthew xxv.
we have a series of images, in which the terrors of the "great
day of the Lord" are set forth. The virgins that go out to meet
the Bridegroom, the servants with their talents, the Judge
dividing all brought before Him as a shepherd divideth the sheep
from the goats, are warnings of the certainty and severity of
judgment, and of the doom reserved for the ungodly.</p>
<p>"The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment
unto the Son."<a name="FNanchor162"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_162"><sup>[162]</sup></a> As God, He has all things
naked and open before Him. As man, He became subject to human
conditions, and was in all points tempted as we are, yet without
sin. Our Judge knows our frame, our temptations, our weakness,
our difficulties; and in the Judgment, as in His life on earth,
He will not break the bruised reed, or apply to men's conduct a
harsher measure than they have merited. Judgment will begin at
the house of God, and sentence on the ungodly will be severe in
proportion to knowledge, privilege, and opportunity. Men will be
judged by their works, and in this doctrine of Scripture there is
no opposition to that of justification by faith. Men cannot be
justified by their own works, but if Christ be in them and the
Spirit of God dwell in their hearts, then, being dead to sin,
they follow holiness. The distinction between the children of God
and the children of the devil is this, that the former class
bring forth the fruits of righteousness, and the latter the
fruits of sin. "A good man out of the good treasure of the heart
bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil
treasure bringeth forth evil things."<a name="FNanchor163"></a><a
href="#Footnote_163"><sup>[163]</sup></a> In the Judgment the
works of every man shall be brought to light, whether they be
good or evil. "There is nothing covered, that shall not be
revealed; and hid, that shall not be known."<a name=
"FNanchor164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164"><sup>[164]</sup></a>
The just shall be rewarded, not on account of their good works,
but because of the atonement and righteousness of Christ; yet
their works will be the test of their sanctification and the
proof that they are members of Christ and regenerated by His
Spirit.</p>

<h2><a href="#ARTICLE_8_2">ARTICLE 8</a></h2>
<p><i>I believe in the Holy Ghost</i></p>
<br>

<p>The eighth article of the Creed declares belief in the third
Divine Person&mdash;the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>The words "I believe," implied in every clause, are here
repeated, to mark the transition from the Second to the Third
Person of the Trinity.</p>
<p>While this doctrine underlies all the teaching of the Old
Testament Scriptures, it was yet in a measure not understood or
realised by the Jews, and as Christ came to make known the
Father, so to Him we owe also the full revelation of the Holy
Spirit. Prophets and Psalmists had glimpses of the doctrine, but
they lived in the twilight, and saw through a glass darkly many
truths now clearly made known.</p>
<p>While we speak freely of spiritual life, our conception of it
is so vague that we are apt to overlook, or to regard lightly,
the work of the Holy Spirit in redemption. The disciples of John,
whom Paul met at Ephesus, believed in Jesus and had been
baptized, and yet they told the Apostle that they had not so much
as heard whether there was any Holy Ghost.<a name=
"FNanchor165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165"><sup>[165]</sup></a>
John tells us that even while Jesus was on earth the Holy Ghost
was not yet given, because that Jesus was not yet glorified.<a
name="FNanchor166"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_166"><sup>[166]</sup></a></p>
<p>That the Holy Ghost is a Person, and not, as some hold, a mere
energy or influence proceeding from the Father, or from the
Father and the Son, is apparent from the passages of Scripture
which refer to Him. An energy has no existence independent of the
agent, but this can not be maintained with reference to the Holy
Ghost. He is associated as a Person with Persons. In the
baptismal formula and in the apostolic benediction the Holy
Spirit is spoken of in the same terms as the Father and the Son,
and is therefore a Person as they are Persons. He is said to
possess will and understanding. He is said to teach, to testify,
to intercede, to search all things, to bestow and distribute
spiritual gifts according to His will.</p>
<p>The Holy Ghost addresses the Father, and is therefore not the
Father. He intercedes with the Father, and so is not a mere
energy of the Father. Jesus promised to send the Spirit from the
Father, but the Father could not be sent from or by Himself. It
is said that the Spirit when He came would not speak of
Himself&mdash;a statement that cannot apply to the Father; and
while Christ promised to send the Spirit, He did not promise to
send the Father.</p>
<p>The Holy Ghost is not the Son, for the Son says He will send
Him. He is "another Comforter," who speaks and acts as a person.
The Holy Ghost said, "Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work
where-unto I have called them."<a name="FNanchor167"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_167"><sup>[167]</sup></a></p>
<p>The arguments for the distinct personality of the Holy Ghost
prove also that He is God. The baptismal formula and the
apostolic benediction assume His Divinity. The words of Christ
with reference to the sin against the Holy Ghost imply that He is
God, and Peter affirms this doctrine when, having accused Ananias
of lying to the Holy Ghost, he adds, "Thou hast not lied unto
men, but unto God."<a name="FNanchor168"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_168"><sup>[168]</sup></a> Paul also asserts it when,
in arguing against sins of the flesh, he affirms that the body is
the temple of the Holy Ghost, and also declares of it that the
temple of GOD is holy. Divine properties are ascribed to the Holy
Spirit. Thus <i>Omnipotence</i> is attributed to Him&mdash;"The
Spirit shall quicken your mortal bodies",<a name=
"FNanchor169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169"><sup>[169]</sup></a>
<i>Omniscience</i>&mdash;"The Spirit searcheth all things",<a
name="FNanchor170"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_170"><sup>[170]</sup></a>
<i>Omnipresence</i>&mdash;"Whither shall I go from thy Spirit?"<a
name="FNanchor171"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_171"><sup>[171]</sup></a> Divinity is attributed to
the third Person in the statement that "holy men of God spake as
they were moved by the Holy Ghost,"<a name="FNanchor172"></a><a
href="#Footnote_172"><sup>[172]</sup></a> taken in connection
with the other statement, "all Scripture is given by inspiration
of God."<a name="FNanchor173"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_173"><sup>[173]</sup></a></p>
<p>Jesus was conceived by the Holy Ghost, and, because of this,
though born of a woman, He was in His human nature the Son of
God. "The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee ... therefore also that
holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of
God."<a name="FNanchor174"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_174"><sup>[174]</sup></a> Each of the three Persons
has part in the work of redemption. The Father gave the Son, and
accepted Him as man's Sinbearer and Sacrifice; the Son gave
Himself, and assumed human nature that He might suffer and die in
the room and stead of sinners, and the Holy Ghost applies to men
the work of redeeming love, taking of the things of Christ and
making them known,<a name="FNanchor175"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_175"><sup>[175]</sup></a> till they produce
repentance, faith, and salvation. The Father's gift of the Son
and the Son's sacrifice of Himself are of the past; the work of
the Holy Spirit has gone on day by day, ever since the risen and
glorified Redeemer sent Him to make His people ready for the
place which He is preparing for them. It is through Him that we
understand the Scriptures, and receive power to fear God and keep
His commandments. He comes to human hearts, and when He enters He
banishes discord and bestows happiness and peace. Then with the
heart man believeth unto righteousness, and the fruits of the
Spirit are manifested in his life. The love of the Father and the
redemption secured by the Son's Incarnation and Passion fail to
affect us if we have not our share in the Spirit's
sanctification. There is a sense in which the Holy Ghost comes
nearer to us, if we may so speak, than the other Persons of the
Godhead. If we are true believers, the Holy Ghost is enthroned in
our hearts. "He dwelleth with you, and shall be in you."<a name=
"FNanchor176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176"><sup>[176]</sup></a>
Our bodies become the temples of the Holy Ghost.<a name=
"FNanchor177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177"><sup>[177]</sup></a> It
is through Him that the Father and the Son come and make their
abode in the faithful.<a name="FNanchor178"></a><a href=

Spirit of Christ, he is none of his."<a name="FNanchor180"></a><a
href="#Footnote_180"><sup>[180]</sup></a> When we consider the
work He carries on in convicting men of sin, of righteousness,
and of judgment, and in converting, guiding, and comforting those
whom He influences, we can understand that it was expedient for
us that Christ should go away, in order that the Comforter might
come.<a name="FNanchor181"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_181"><sup>[181]</sup></a> If we are receiving and
resting on Jesus as our Saviour, then His Spirit is within us as
the earnest of our inheritance.<a name="FNanchor182"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_182"><sup>[182]</sup></a> His presence imparts power
such as no spiritual enemy can resist. How different were the
Apostles before and after they had received the gift of the
Spirit! One of them who, before, denied Christ when challenged by
a maid, afterwards proclaimed boldly in the presence of the
hostile Jewish council, "We ought to obey God rather than men."<a
name="FNanchor183"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_183"><sup>[183]</sup></a> Those who, when He was
apprehended, had forsaken Him and fled, gathered courage to brave
kings and rulers as they preached salvation through Him. The
disciples, who, in accordance with Christ's injunction, awaited
the descent of the Spirit, were on the day of Pentecost clothed
with power before which bigotry and selfishness passed into faith
and charity and self-surrender; and there was won on that day for
the Church a triumph such as the might of God alone could have
secured&mdash;a triumph which the ministry of the Spirit,
whenever it is recognised and accepted, is always powerful to
repeat and to surpass.</p>
<p>All good comes to man through the Spirit. Every inspiration of
every individual is from Him, the Lord and Giver of light, and
life, and understanding. Every good thought that rises within us,
every unselfish motive that stimulates us, every desire to be
holy, every resolve to do what is right, what is brave, or noble,
or self-sacrificing, comes to man from the Holy Ghost. He is
instructing and directing us not only on special occasions, as
when we read the Bible or meet for worship, but always, if we
will listen for His voice. His personal indwelling in man, as
Counsellor and Guide, is the fulfilment of the promise&mdash;"I
will dwell in them, and walk in them." "He will guide you into
all truth" is an assurance of counsel and victory that is ever
receiving fulfilment, and that cannot be broken.<a name=

<p><i>The Holy Catholic Church, the Communion of Saints</i></p>
<p>SECTION 1.&mdash;THE HOLY CATHOLIC CHURCH</p>
<br>

<p>In the clause of the Creed which expresses belief in Jesus
Christ, He is called our Lord "And in Jesus Christ our Lord."
That He is their Lord is declared by believers, when they term
the society of which they are members "the Church." This word is
derived from the Greek <i>kurios</i>, Lord, in the adjectival
form <i>kuriakos</i>, of or belonging to the Lord&mdash;the
Scottish word "kirk" being therefore a form nearer the original
than the equivalent term <i>Church</i>. The Greek word translated
"church" occurs only three times in the Gospels. In English the
word is used in different senses, all of them, however, pointing
to the Lord Jesus as their source and sanction. By "church," we
sometimes mean a building set apart for Christian worship. The
Jew had his Tabernacle in the Wilderness, his Temple at
Jerusalem, and his Synagogue in the Provinces; the Mohammedan has
his Mosque, and the Brahmin his Pagoda; but the Christian has his
Church, in whose very name his Lord is honoured. Sometimes the
word denotes the Christians of a specified city or
locality&mdash;the Church at Ephesus, the Church at Corinth.
Sometimes it is limited to a number of Christians meeting for
worship in a house, as in Romans xvi. 5 and in Philemon.<a name=
"FNanchor185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185"><sup>[185]</sup></a>
Sometimes "Church" denotes a particular denomination of
Christians, as the Presbyterian Church, the Episcopal Church.
Sometimes it expresses the distinctive form which Christianity
assumes in a particular nation&mdash;the Church of England, the
Church of Scotland. In the Creed the Holy Catholic Church means
the whole body of believers in the Lord Jesus Christ, all who
anywhere and everywhere are looking to Him for salvation, and are
bringing forth the fruits of holiness to His praise and
glory.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus Christ did not, during His ministry, set up a
Church as an outward organisation. He was Himself to be the
Church's foundation; but in order to be qualified for this office
it was necessary that He should first lay down His life. The work
of building and extending, in so far as it was to be effected by
human agency, must be undertaken by others after His departure.
He came to fulfil the law, and so He was not sent save to the
lost sheep of the house of Israel. He worshipped, accordingly, in
the Jewish temple and synagogues, observed the sacraments and
festivals of the Old Testament Church, and during His earthly
ministry bade His disciples observe and do whatsoever the men who
sat in Moses' seat commanded. "The faithful saying, worthy of all
acceptation," with which the Christian Church was to be charged
as God's message to the world, was not yet published, for Christ
had still to suffer and enter into His glory, and the Holy Ghost
had yet to be sent by the Father before the standard of the
Church could be set up. While the Church rests on Christ, it is
founded upon His Apostles also, to whom He committed the work for
which He had prepared them, and for which He was still further to
qualify them by bestowing power from on high. The gifts which He
received for men when He ascended were needed to equip them for
the work of founding that Church, which became a possibility only
through His death and resurrection. Applying to them the
redemption purchased by Christ, the Holy Ghost wrought in and
with them, and crowned their labours with success. The Christian
Church was set up on the day of Pentecost, when the Holy Ghost
came down upon a band of believers assembled at Jerusalem waiting
for the promise of the Father. Under His inspiration Peter
preached the first Christian sermon with such power that the same
day there were added unto the Church three thousand souls.</p>
<p>The Church is termed the <i>Holy</i> Catholic Church. When the
epithet "holy" is applied to the Church, it is not meant that all
who profess faith in Jesus Christ and are in connection with the
visible Church, are holy, or that any of them are altogether
holy. Our Lord taught that while in the world His Church would
contain a mixture of good and bad. He likened it to a net in
which good and bad fishes are caught, and to a field in which
wheat and tares grow together. Though all are called to be
saints, "there is not a just man upon earth that doeth good, and
sinneth not."<a name="FNanchor186"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_186"><sup>[186]</sup></a> The sanctification of
believers is the work of the Holy Spirit, effected not by a
momentary act but by degrees, and never perfected in this
life.</p>
<p>Upon all who truly receive the Lord Jesus a change is wrought
by the Holy Spirit of God, which results in holiness. Looking
unto Jesus, they behold as in a glass the glory of the Lord, and
are changed into the same image. The transformation which they
undergo extends to every part of their being. The subject of
sanctification is the whole man. The understanding, will,
conscience, memory, affections are all renewed in their
operations, and the members of the body become instruments of
righteousness unto holiness. As believers are enabled to die unto
sin, they live unto righteousness. Being renewed in the inner man
by the Divine Spirit, they bring forth the fruits of the Spirit.
Their desire is after holiness, for they know that the
restoration of holiness is the end for which Jesus died and for
which the Spirit works. "Christ loved the church, and gave
himself for it; that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the
washing of water by the word, that he might present it to himself
a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such
thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish."<a name=
"FNanchor187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187"><sup>[187]</sup></a>
Now, the Church is marred by many blemishes, but her imperfection
is for a time only. When her period of work and probation is
accomplished she will be purged and perfected, and will be a
church without spot or wrinkle. Meantime she is the Holy Church
because her Head is holy, and because she is called out of the
world and consecrated to the service of God. She is holy because
she is the body of Christ, of whose fulness she receives, and
whose graces she reflects, and because it is through her
teaching, prayers, and institutions that the Holy Spirit usually
works and influences men to follow holiness. The ministry, the
preaching, the sacraments, the laws, and the discipline of the
Church have as their end the turning of men from their sins and
persuading them to follow holiness.</p>
<p>The Christian Church is a <i>Catholic</i> Church. The word
"Catholic" means universal, and implies that, unlike the Jewish
Church, which was narrow and local, requiring admission to
earthly citizenship as the condition of receiving spiritual
privilege, the Church of Christ is coextensive with humanity, and
accessible to all. The Master's charge was that the Gospel should
be preached to every creature. The Church's field is the world,
and her commission sets before her as a duty that she shall go
into all the world bearing the glad tidings of salvation. The
disciples did not at first realise this comprehensiveness of the
new faith. Even after his address on the day of Pentecost, Peter
had not risen above his Jewish prejudices. It was not until after
he beheld in vision the great sheet let down from heaven, and was
forbidden to regard anything which God had cleansed as common or
unclean, that the fulness of the Gospel dispensation was
understood by him, and he discovered to his astonishment that God
is no respecter of persons, but that in every nation he that
feareth Him and worketh righteousness is acceptable to Him.<a
name="FNanchor188"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_188"><sup>[188]</sup></a></p>
<p>The Catholic Church is <i>One</i>. It is <i>the</i> Holy
Catholic Church, one in its origin as the household of God built
upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, Jesus Christ
being the chief corner-stone;<a name="FNanchor189"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_189"><sup>[189]</sup></a> one body, with one hope, one
Lord, one faith, one baptism.<a name="FNanchor190"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_190"><sup>[190]</sup></a> The distinctive marks of the
true Church are allegiance to one Lord, confession of a common
creed, and participation in the same Sacraments.</p>
<p>The unity of the Catholic Church is quite compatible with the
existence of separate organisations that differ in regard to
details of government or worship. There is no outward
organisation which possesses a monopoly of Christian truth and
privilege. While all who "hold the Head" stand fast in one
spirit, they are not all enrolled as members of one
ecclesiastical body, or subject to the authority of one earthly
ruler. Their citizenship is in heaven; not in Rome or in any city
of this world. The claim asserted by the Bishops of Rome to be
infallible representatives of Christ and exclusive possessors of
the keys of the kingdom of heaven, to whom all men owe
allegiance, and whose decrees and discipline cannot be questioned
without sin, has no support in Scripture, which, while it enjoins
unity of spirit, never prescribes uniformity of organisation.</p>
<p>What the Romanist claims for the Pope is virtually claimed for
the Church by some who reject Papal authority. By the Church they
mean one visible body of Christians under the same ecclesiastical
constitution and government, and they maintain that the right to
expound with authority the will of God is vested in this body,
and that private judgment must be subordinated to its decisions.
To constitute the Church they say there must be bishops at its
head, ordained by men whose ecclesiastical orders have come down
from apostolic times in unbroken succession. Without this
apostolical succession, it is affirmed, there can be no Church,
no true ordination, no valid or effectual administration of
sacraments.</p>
<p>Such a definition of the Catholic Church excludes from
participation in the ordinary means of grace the whole body of
Presbyterians, nearly all the Protestant Churches of Europe, and
all who refuse to admit direct transmission of orders from the
Apostles as a primary condition of the Church's existence.
Carried to its logical conclusion, it would exclude even those
who maintain it; for all attempts to trace back a continuous and
complete series of ordinations from modern times to the apostolic
age fail to show an unbroken line. It is therefore not possible
for any bishop or minister in Christendom to be certain that, in
this sense, he is a successor of the Apostles. The Catholic
Church is not exclusively Episcopalian or Presbyterian or
Congregational. It is found in all Christian communities, and
maintains its identity in all. It is said by Paul to be made up
of "them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be
saints, with all that call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
in every place, their Lord and ours."<a name="FNanchor191"></a><a
href="#Footnote_191"><sup>[191]</sup></a> As it is not the Pope
that admits to, or excludes from, heaven, so it is not the
prerogative of any church to bestow or to withhold salvation. The
right of private judgment, asserted and secured by the Scottish
Reformers, is one which we are not only entitled but bound to
exercise. We must search the Scriptures for ourselves, that in
their light we may prove all things and hold fast that which is
good. A famous saying of Ignatius, who first applied the term
"Catholic" to the Church, supplies the true description of a
living church&mdash;"Wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the
Catholic Church."<a name="FNanchor192"></a><a href=

<p>SECTION 2.&mdash;THE COMMUNION OF SAINTS</p>
<br>

<p>This article appears to have first found place in the Creed as
a protest against the tenets of a sect called the Donatists, from
Donatus their leader. He seceded (314 A.D.) from the Christian
Church in North Africa, carrying with him numerous followers, and
set up a new church organisation, claiming for it place and
authority as the only Church of Christ. Circumstances put powers
of excommunication and persecution at his disposal, which he
directed against those who refused to become his followers.</p>
<p>Augustine was for a time a Donatist, but his truth-loving
spirit soon discovered the real character of Donatus, and then he
became his active and uncompromising opponent. It was probably as
a protest against the arrogance of the Donatists, and in
deference to Augustine's wish, that the clause was inserted. In
this profession it is declared that the Holy Catholic Church is
one not in virtue of outward forms, or even through perfect
agreement among its members upon all details of doctrine, but
because of the holiness of those who compose it. It refuses to
excommunicate any who hold fast the form of sound words, and who
adhere to one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of
all. It is a brotherhood of which all who have the spirit of
Christ are members. Differences in colour, or country, or rank do
not suffice to separate those who are "the body of Christ and
members in particular." The spirit of Christian fellowship that
marks the saints finds fitting expression in the noble words of
Augustine, "In things essential, unity; in things doubtful,
liberty; in all things, charity."</p>
<p>The primary meaning of the word "saint" is a person
consecrated or set apart. In this sense all baptized persons who
are professing members of the Church of Christ are saints. In the
New Testament the whole body of professing Christians resident in
a city or district are called saints, although some among them
may have been unworthy; just as in the Old Testament the prophets
even in degenerate times termed the people of Israel an "holy
nation," that is, a nation separated from the rest of the world
and consecrated to God's service. Thus we read that Peter visited
the saints which dwelt at Lydda.<a name="FNanchor193"></a><a
href="#Footnote_193"><sup>[193]</sup></a> Paul speaks of a
collection for the poor saints at Jerusalem, and writes letters
to all the saints in Achaia,<a name="FNanchor194"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_194"><sup>[194]</sup></a> to all the saints in Christ
Jesus at Philippi, and to the saints at Ephesus; and Jude speaks
of the faith once delivered to the saints. In these passages the
title is applied to all who were in outward fellowship with the
Christian Church.</p>
<p>The term "saint" is used also in a more restricted sense. As
they were not all Israel who were of Israel, and as not every one
that saith "Lord, Lord" shall enter into the kingdom of heaven,
so all who are enrolled as members of the Christian Church do not
lead saintly lives, and those only are truly saints who are
striving to live godly in Christ Jesus, and to be holy, even as
He who hath called them is holy. This clause of the Creed
expresses the doctrine that Christians ought to have fellowship
one with another, and that there ought to be harmonious relations
and stimulating communion between their several churches and
congregations&mdash;such fellowship and communion as may lead the
world to believe that they are one in Christ, and that, though
compelled by circumstances to assemble in different places and to
form separate societies, they are, nevertheless, all members of
one body, of which Jesus Christ is the Head; all stones in one
building, of which He is the chief Corner-stone; all branches in
one true vine, of which He is the Stem; and all animated and
directed by the same Spirit. Thus regarded, the clause is a
protest against the exclusiveness which often marks Christian
churches, and is a recognition of the spirit of charity.</p>
<p>The extent of this Communion of the Saints is not revealed.
Much of it is spiritual, and is therefore invisible to us. God
alone marks in full measure the fellowship of the churches, and
is acquainted with the character and conduct of all their
members. He knew the seven thousand in Israel who had never bowed
the knee to Baal, and the real, though unrecognised, communion
they had with one another in their common fidelity and prayer to
Him; but Elijah did not know how much true fellowship he had,
when he denounced the idolatries of Jezebel and pleaded with God
for Israel. The ignorance of the prophet, who thought he was the
only faithful Israelite, has its counterpart in our own times.
God knows, but we do not know, how many faithful saints there are
in the world who are in fellowship with one another because they
are in fellowship with Him. We are excluded by many barriers from
the knowledge of our brethren and sisters in Christ Jesus.
Natural and moral difficulties stand in the way, hindering this
knowledge; differences in language, in environment, in habits and
modes of thought, and other limitations, disable us for truly
gauging the character of those with whom we are brought into
close contact. Communion is nevertheless real and true. The
members of the Church of the living God, however they may be
scattered and divided, have communion and fellowship with the
Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost; and being in fellowship with
God, they are of one mind, and are knit together by common faith
and mutual sympathy. They are all one with the same Head, and
they have all one hope of their calling.</p>
<p>Our Lord brought life and immortality to light, and taught men
that between the Church militant and the Church triumphant there
is indissoluble fellowship. Those who followed holiness in this
life are saints still in the life to which they have passed. In
the Epistle to the Hebrews, believers are told that they "are
come to the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which
are written in heaven ... and to the spirits of just men made
perfect."<a name="FNanchor195"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_195"><sup>[195]</sup></a></p>
<p>While the clause was probably inserted at first to vindicate
the doctrine of communion of saints in this life, it has long
been regarded as extending to a communion subsisting between the
spirits of just men made perfect and followers of the Lord Jesus
Christ who are still on earth. The passage last quoted justifies
the inference that death does not suspend the fellowship which
believers in Jesus Christ have with Him, their common Lord. Death
separates the soul from the body, but it does not cut off the
dead from communion with the Father or the Son. He who is the God
of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob is the God not of the dead,
but of the living. Of the whole family of the saints, some are in
heaven and some on earth, and, between those who are there and
those who are here, there is communion. Since the heavenly Church
received Abel as its first member, there has been unceasing
fellowship between militant and glorified saints. Those who are
here are shut out by the tabernacle of the body from personal
intercourse with the souls of the departed, but are yet in a
fellowship with them that is very real and precious. The holy
dead act upon the living, and, it may be, are reacted upon in
ways we do not understand. Of Abel we are told that "being dead,
he yet speaketh."<a name="FNanchor196"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_196"><sup>[196]</sup></a> Those whom death has taken
do not cease to exert an influence on the lives of friends left
behind. Their example, their good deeds, their writings, the
undying consequences of what they did while on earth affect us.
The veil which death interposes between us and them hinders us
from witnessing their spirit life, and we know not whether, or in
what measure, or how, they contemplate us. We do not go to them
to ask them to intercede for us with the Father, for we believe
there is but one Mediator between God and man. We do not invest
them with attributes which belong to God alone; all that we are
warranted to say about their relation to us is, that what is
revealed does not forbid, but rather encourages, the thought that
they are interested in us and concerned for our happiness. If the
angels rejoice over the conversion of a sinner, are we to think
that the spirits of just men made perfect are strangers to this
joy? They are within the veil, we cannot see them, but we know
they are in communion with God. The condition of the departed
saints is one of waiting as well as of progress. They have not
attained to fruition. There are doctrines which to them, as to
us, are still matters not of experience but of faith and hope.
The souls of the martyrs seen by John under the altar were in a
state of expectation, desiring and pleading as when in the flesh
they had desired and pleaded for the consummation of Messiah's
kingdom; and from them the Apostle heard the cry ascend, "How
long, O Lord?"<a name="FNanchor197"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_197"><sup>[197]</sup></a> Saints here and saints who
have passed through the valley into the unseen must surely hold
many beliefs in common. Both alike believe the promises of God,
and anticipate the glorious consummation for which they wait and
watch, when the kingdoms of this world shall become the kingdoms
of the living God. They believe in the resurrection of the body
and in its reunion with the soul for ever. They have common
affections. Their love is given to the same God. They have
community of worship, and have communion in thanksgiving, praise,
and, may we not say, in prayer for the overthrow of the kingdom
of darkness and the advent of the kingdom of glory? As those who
are still in the body keep the New Testament feast, they feel
that there is fellowship between them and saints departed, seeing
that they honour the same Saviour, glory in the same cross,
partake of the same heavenly food, and look for the same
inheritance of perfect blessedness.</p>

<p><i>The Forgiveness of Sins</i></p>
<br>

<p>The Creed acknowledges God as the Father Almighty, Maker of
heaven and earth; but there is another relation which He sustains
to His creatures besides those of Creator and Father. In
Scripture He is represented as the King, Ruler, Governor of the
universe, who imposes laws upon all His creatures, and requires
of them scrupulous obedience. With the exception of man, the
visible creatures have these laws, from which they cannot swerve,
within their constitutions. The planet never deviates from its
appointed orbit; the insect, the bird, the beast all live in
strict accordance with their instincts; but, unlike them, man
possesses freedom of will and power of choice. This freedom, if
rightly exercised, is a noble possession, but, perverted, it is
an instrument of destruction. The lower animals cannot sin
because the law of their lives is within them, constraining them
to act in accordance with its dictates. Upon man, free to choose,
God imposed law. With freedom of will he received the gift of
conscience, which, enabling him to distinguish between right and
wrong, invested him with responsibility, and made disobedience
sin. That he can sin is his patent of nobility, that he does sin
is his ruin and disgrace.</p>
<p>The effect of sin is separation from God, who can have no
fellowship with evil, for sin is the abominable thing which He
hates, and on which He cannot even look. A breach, altogether
irreparable on man's part, was made between man and his Creator
when the first transgression of the law of God took place. The
impulse of every sinner, which only Divine power can overcome, is
to flee from God. Hence arises the necessity for reconciliation,
and for the intervention of God to effect it. That the unity thus
broken may be restored, expiation must be made by one possessing
the nature of the being that had sinned, and yet, by His
possession of the Divine nature, investing that expiation with
illimitable worth, so that all sin may be covered, and every
sinner find a way of escape from the power and the penal
consequences of transgression. These conditions meet in the Lord
Jesus Christ and in Him alone. That God might, without
compromising His attributes, be enabled to bring man back into
fellowship with Himself, He spared not His own Son, and the Son
freely gave Himself to suffering and death for the world's
redemption.</p>
<p>In the felt necessity of atonement, which has associated
sacrifice with every religion devised by man, we have evidence of
the universality of sin. All feel its crushing pressure, and fear
the punishment which, conscience assures them, is deserved and
inevitable. The heathen confesses it as he prostrates himself
before the image of his god, or immolates himself or his
fellow-man upon his altar; and the Christian feels and confesses
it as, fleeing for refuge, he finds pardon and cleansing in the
blood of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Sin is original or actual, the former inherited from our
parents, the latter, personal transgression of the Divine law.
Every man descending from Adam by ordinary generation is born
with the taint of original sin. As the representative head of
humanity, Adam transmitted to all his descendants the nature that
his sin had polluted. The fountain of life was poisoned at its
source, and when Adam begat children they were born in his
likeness. "By one man sin entered into the world, and death by
sin; and so death passed upon all men." "Death reigned ... even
over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's
transgression." "By one man's disobedience many were made
sinners."<a name="FNanchor198"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_198"><sup>[198]</sup></a></p>
<p>Actual sin consists in breaking any law of God made known to
us by Scripture, conscience, or reason. It assumes many forms.
There are sins of thought, of word, of deed; sins of commission,
or doing what God forbids; of omission, or leaving undone what
God commands; sins to which we are tempted by the world, the
flesh, or the devil; sins directly against God; sins that wrong
our neighbours, and that ruin ourselves; sins of pride,
covetousness, lust, gluttony, anger, envy, sloth. In many things
we sin, and "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves,
and the truth is not in us."<a name="FNanchor199"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_199"><sup>[199]</sup></a></p>
<p>Man's sinfulness is set forth in Scripture by a great variety
of figures. The word rendered "sin" means the missing of a mark
or aim. Sin is sometimes described as ignorance, sometimes as
defeat, sometimes as disobedience. The definition of the Shorter
Catechism is clear and comprehensive. "Sin is any want of
conformity unto, or transgression of, the law of God."<a name=
"FNanchor200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200"><sup>[200]</sup></a>
The taint of original sin, extending to man's whole nature,
inclines him to act in opposition to the law of God, and every
concession to his corrupt desire, in thought, word, or deed, is
actual sin. Because of it he is not subject to the law of God,
neither, indeed, can be.</p>
<p>Sin is always spoken of in Scripture as followed by punishment
or by pardon. There is no middle way. Salvation for man must
therefore involve deliverance from condemnation.</p>
<p>The word which expresses man's liability to punishment is
"guilt," and only a religion which makes known how he may be set
free from guilt will suit his necessities. We cannot set
ourselves free from condemnation. "Man," says the Confession of
Faith, "by his fall into a state of sin, hath wholly lost all
ability of will to any spiritual good accompanying salvation; so,
as a natural man, being altogether averse from that good, and
dead in sin, is not able, by his own strength, to convert
himself, or prepare himself thereunto."<a name=
"FNanchor201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201"><sup>[201]</sup></a>
Forgiveness of sin must come from God. There is nothing in nature
or in human experience to warrant hope of pardon. Nature never
forgives a trespass against her law. The opportunity that is lost
does not return. The mistake by which a life is marred cannot be
undone. The constitution shattered by intemperance cannot be
restored, the birthright bartered for a mess of pottage is gone
for ever, and no bitter tears or supplications have power to
bring it back. Whether we repent of it or not, every sin we
commit leaves its dark mark behind, and in this life at least the
stain can never be effaced; and yet we believe in the forgiveness
of sin through the grace of God.</p>
<p>The forgiveness of sin is a free gift purchased by "the Lamb
of God that taketh away the sin of the world," who by His Cross
and Passion obtained for men this unspeakable benefit, and
commanded that repentance and remission of sins should be
preached in His name among all nations.<a name=
"FNanchor202"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_202"><sup>[202]</sup></a></p>
<p>In order that the grace of God may bring salvation, it is
required that there shall be (<i>a</i>) Repentance. In Scripture
repentance is set forth as necessarily preceding pardon: "Jesus
began to preach, and to say, Repent."<a name="FNanchor203"></a><a
href="#Footnote_203"><sup>[203]</sup></a> "Peter said unto them,
Repent."<a name="FNanchor204"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_204"><sup>[204]</sup></a> "Him hath God exalted with
his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give
repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins."<a name=
"FNanchor205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205"><sup>[205]</sup></a>
Repentance begins in contrition. "Godly sorrow for sin worketh
repentance to salvation."<a name="FNanchor206"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_206"><sup>[206]</sup></a> (<i>b</i>) Before the good
gift of God can be received, it is necessary that we confess our
sin. It is when we confess our sins that we obtain forgiveness
and cleansing. "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just
to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all
unrighteousness."<a name="FNanchor207"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_207"><sup>[207]</sup></a> To produce conviction and
confession is the work of the Holy Ghost. He reveals to the
sinner the sinfulness of his life, and so works in him
repentance. (<i>c</i>) Another requirement is unfeigned faith.
"He that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a
rewarder of them that diligently seek Him." "Without faith it is
impossible to please him."<a name="FNanchor208"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_208"><sup>[208]</sup></a> "Being justified by faith,
we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ."<a name=
"FNanchor209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209"><sup>[209]</sup></a>
"Let him ask in faith, nothing doubting: for he that doubteth is
like the surge of the sea driven by the wind and tossed. For let
not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord."<a
name="FNanchor210"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_210"><sup>[210]</sup></a> (<i>d</i>) There must be
also humble, earnest resolution to be obedient to the will of
God. The forgiveness secured by the death of Jesus is more than
mere deliverance from the penalty of sin or the acquittal of the
sinner. It is the remission of sins, the putting away of the sin.
With pardon there is a renewal of the inner man. Return to
holiness is secured, and the lost image of God is restored to
man, so that he dies to sin and lives unto holiness. Nothing less
than this will satisfy the true penitent, who asks for more than
pardon, whose cry is, "Create in me a clean heart, O God; and
renew a right spirit within me."<a name="FNanchor211"></a><a
href="#Footnote_211"><sup>[211]</sup></a> It is not sufficient to
be set free from punishment, there must be the abiding desire to
have the life conformed to the Divine will. "The grace of God
that bringeth salvation" teaches and enables all who receive it
"to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live soberly,
righteously, and godly in this present world."<a name=

<p><i>The Resurrection of the Body</i></p>
<br>

<p>ANIMISM&mdash;the doctrine of the continuous existence, after
death, of the disembodied human spirit&mdash;has a place in the
majority of religious systems; but belief in the resurrection of
the body is almost peculiar to the Christian faith. In Old
Testament times the hope of immortality for body and soul seldom
found expression. Job seems to have had at least a glimpse of the
doctrine, although his words in the original do not express it so
strongly as those of the English version: "I know that my
redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon
the earth: and though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet
in my flesh shall I see God."<a name="FNanchor213"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_213"><sup>[213]</sup></a> In the Psalms there are
various intimations that faithful servants of God looked for a
future life in which the body as well as the spirit should find
place. Isaiah prophesied, "Thy dead men shall live, my dead body
shall arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew
is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead."<a
name="FNanchor214"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_214"><sup>[214]</sup></a> Daniel still more
emphatically declares, "Many of them that sleep in the dust of
the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to
shame and everlasting contempt."<a name="FNanchor215"></a><a
href="#Footnote_215"><sup>[215]</sup></a> The story in the second
book of Maccabees of the seven martyr-brothers, who would not
accept life from the tyrant on condition of denying their God,
proves that they were strengthened to endure by the sure hope of
"a better resurrection." One of them thus confessed his faith:
"Thou like a fury takest us out of this present life, but the
King of the world shall raise us up, who have died for His laws,
unto everlasting life." Another of the brothers, about to have
his tongue plucked out and his hands cut off, "holding forth his
hands manfully, said courageously, These I had from heaven ...
and from Him I hope to receive them again." Their mother, who is
thought to have been one of the saints that in the Epistle to the
Hebrews are said to have been tortured, not accepting
deliverance, encouraged her sons to be faithful unto death by
telling them that God who had given them life at the first would
restore it. "I am sure," she said, "that He will of His own mercy
give you breath and life again as ye now regard not your own
selves for His laws' sake."<a name="FNanchor216"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_216"><sup>[216]</sup></a> The Pharisees in the days of
our Lord held by the doctrine, which the Sadducees, who rejected
belief in angels and spirits, denied. The belief expressed by
Martha when she said of her brother Lazarus, "I know that he
shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day,"<a name=
"FNanchor217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217"><sup>[217]</sup></a>
was in all likelihood current in her time. It may have been to
impress the truth of resurrection-life for the body that Enoch,
before the flood, and Elijah, in later Old Testament times, were
translated; but it is in the New Testament, in words spoken by
the Lord Jesus, that resurrection is fully revealed. "Marvel not
at this," said He to the Jews; "for the hour is coming in the
which all that are in the graves shall hear the voice of the Son
of man, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the
resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the
resurrection of damnation."<a name="FNanchor218"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_218"><sup>[218]</sup></a> In reply to the Sadducees,
who attempted to ridicule His statements regarding resurrection,
He said, "Ye do err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of
God";<a name="FNanchor219"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_219"><sup>[219]</sup></a> and He put them to silence
by showing that the truth of resurrection was implied in the name
by which God revealed Himself to Israel, "I am the God of
Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob." He showed His power over
the dead body, and furnished assurance of resurrection, by
raising the dead. He thus restored the daughter of Jairus and the
son of the widow of Nain, and raised Lazarus from the tomb four
days after he had died. In His own resurrection we have the most
signal pledge of our bodily immortality. When He arose triumphant
from the grave and showed Himself alive by many infallible
proofs, He manifested His power as the conqueror of death.</p>
<p>It is clearly taught in Scripture that there is to be a
general resurrection of the righteous and the wicked. In addition
to texts already quoted, we find John declaring, "I saw the dead,
small and great, stand before God, ... and the sea gave up the
dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead
which were in them";<a name="FNanchor220"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_220"><sup>[220]</sup></a> and Paul writes to the
Thessalonians, "We that are alive, that are left unto the coming
of the Lord, shall in no wise precede them that are fallen asleep
... and the dead in Christ shall rise first."<a name=
"FNanchor221"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_221"><sup>[221]</sup></a></p>
<p>The resurrection is associated with the second coming of
Christ. It is His voice that shall awake the dead, and the angels
who will accompany Him are to gather them from the four winds of
heaven to the judgment-seat of Christ, "that everyone may receive
the things done in his body, according to that he hath done,
whether it be good or bad."<a name="FNanchor222"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_222"><sup>[222]</sup></a></p>
<p>In resurrection, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost take part. God
the Father, who "both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up
us by his own power":<a name="FNanchor223"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_223"><sup>[223]</sup></a> God the Son: "As the Father
raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son

<p>Christianity teaches that the body as well as the soul is
redeemed by the Lord Jesus Christ, "the Saviour of the body."<a
name="FNanchor228"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_228"><sup>[228]</sup></a> We are called to glorify God
in our bodies, which are temples of the Holy Ghost, and we must
give account for the deeds done in and through the body, as well
as for those sins which are rather of the mind and will than of
the body. The body will be raised and will be judged. God will
bring to light all hidden things&mdash;actions forgotten by
ourselves, deeds of which the world knows nothing, as well as
those which memory retains and the world knows of. Before that
"great and notable day" our bodies as well as our souls must have
been purged, else we shall never see God. The bodies of the
unjust will rise; but theirs will be resurrection to shame and
everlasting contempt.</p>
<p>It is fitting that reward or punishment should be the portion
of the same souls and bodies that have been faithful or
unfaithful. Christ rose in the same body as He had before His
death, and so shall we. How this is to be accomplished we cannot
tell, but with God all things are possible, and faith rests with
confidence in His power and in His Word. "We wait for a Saviour,
the Lord Jesus Christ: who shall fashion anew the body of our
humiliation, that it may be conformed to the body of his
glory."<a name="FNanchor229"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_229"><sup>[229]</sup></a> While the body is the same
as that in which the soul tabernacled, it will undergo
transformation. Christ will renew the bodily as well as the
spiritual nature of His people. Every part of their being will be
transformed, and their bodies, like Christ's, will be spiritual
bodies. We are to be sanctified wholly; our whole spirit and soul

will find no way of escape. "He that is filthy, let him be filthy

<h2><a href="#ARTICLE_12_2">ARTICLE 12</a></h2>
<p><i>And the Life Everlasting</i></p>
<br>

<p>The great truth affirmed in the concluding article of the
Creed is the Life Everlasting: "The wages of sin is death; but
the gift of God is eternal life."<a name="FNanchor233"></a><a
href="#Footnote_233"><sup>[233]</sup></a> This life will be the
portion of all who are acquitted in the day of judgment, and they
will then enter upon new experiences. Death and hell shall be
cast into the lake of fire, and the redeemed, no longer subject
to imperfection, decay, or death, shall be raised to the right
hand of the Father, where there is fulness of joy; to partake of
those pleasures for evermore which have been purchased for them
by the blood of the Lamb.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note the gradual development of this
doctrine, which was first fully expressed by Him who brought life
and immortality to light. We have the statement of the writer to
the Hebrews that the faith of Old Testament saints had in view
the continuance of life after death in "a better country, that
is, an heavenly." Whether this faith grasped the doctrine of
bodily resurrection, in addition to that of the immortality of
the soul, we are not told. It is remarkable that throughout the
books of Moses there is an absence of reference to the future
life as a motive to holy living. Prosperity and adversity in this
life are set forth as the reward or punishment of conduct,
leading to the inference, either that retribution in the future
life was not revealed, or that it exercised little practical
influence. As time passed the doctrine of everlasting life for
body and soul emerged in the Psalms and in the prophetical
writings, but sometimes side by side with such gloomy views
regarding death and its consequences as to leave the impression
that belief in it was weak and fitful. In the long period that
passed between the time when Old Testament prophecy ceased and
the advent of Christ, the fierce persecutions to which the Jews
were subjected appear to have strengthened their faith in a
future life of blessedness, in which the body, delivered from the
grave and again united to the soul, shall participate.</p>
<p>The author of the Apocryphal Book termed <i>The Wisdom of
Solomon</i> thus records his belief:&mdash;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em;">The souls of the righteous are in
the hand of God,<br>
And no torment shall touch them.<br>
In the eyes of the foolish they seemed to have died;<br>
And their departure was accounted <i>to be their</i> hurt,<br>
And their journeying away from us <i>to be their</i> ruin,<br>
But they are in peace.<br>
For even if in the sight of men they be punished,<br>
Their hope is full of immortality:<br>
And having borne a little chastening they shall receive great
good;<br>
Because God made trial of them, and found them worthy of
Himself.<br>
As gold in the furnace He proved them,<br>
And as a whole burnt offering He accepted them.<br>
And in the time of their visitation they shall shine forth,<br>
And as sparks among stubble they shall run to and fro.<br>
They shall judge nations, and have dominion over peoples;<br>
And the Lord shall reign over them for evermore.<br>
They that trust in Him shall understand truth,<br>
And the faithful shall abide with Him in love;<br>
Because grace and mercy are to His chosen.<br>
<a name="FNanchor234"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_234"><sup>[234]</sup></a><br>
</div>
<p>Again he writes:&mdash;</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em;">The righteous live for ever,<br>
And in the Lord is their reward,<br>
And the care for them with the Most High.<br>
Therefore shall they receive the crown of royal dignity<br>
And the diadem of beauty from the Lord's hand.<a name=
"FNanchor235"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_235"><sup>[235]</sup></a><br>
</div>
<p>The happiness of the kingdom of heaven is in Scripture termed
"life," because it constitutes the life for which man was
created. Being made in the likeness of God, his nature can obtain
full satisfaction, and his powers will expand into fruition, only
when he enters upon a life which resembles, in proportion to its
measure and capacity, the life of God. Jesus spoke of
regeneration as entering into life. Those who receive the Gospel
message and walk in the footsteps of Christ are said to be born
again&mdash;to receive in their conversion the beginning of a new
existence, of which the entrance of the infant into the world is
a fitting emblem. They possess now not only a natural life, but a
life hid with Christ in God, which is a pledge to them that "when
he who is their life shall appear, they also shall appear with
him in glory."<a name="FNanchor236"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_236"><sup>[236]</sup></a> Knowledge of God the Father
and of Jesus Christ, imparted by the Holy Spirit, is said by our
Lord to be Life Eternal. "This is life eternal, to know thee the
only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent."<a name=
"FNanchor237"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_237"><sup>[237]</sup></a></p>
<p>Standing at the end of the Creed, this article expresses the
consummation of the work accomplished for man by the Three
Persons of the Godhead. The Father created man and breathed into
his nostrils the breath of life, that he might glorify God and
enjoy Him for ever; and when, through the fall, man had forfeited
the gift of life, God spared not His own Son, that, through His
dying, pardon and blessed life might be brought within the reach
of the fallen; the Son assumed human nature and suffered and
died, that He might deliver men from death, temporal and eternal,
and procure for them everlasting life; the Holy Ghost, the Giver
of life, sanctifies the believer and makes him meet for the
inheritance of the saints. All the means of grace were given for
the purpose of convincing and converting men, and of preparing
them for entrance into and enjoyment of the blessed life in
eternity.</p>
<p>The <i>Everlasting Life</i> of the Creed covers more than the
immortality of the soul. Even heathens grasped in some measure
the fact that the spirit of man survives separation from the
body; but life for the body in reunion with the soul is a
doctrine of revelation. In the Pagan world various conflicting
beliefs were held as to the condition of men after death. Some
thought that existence terminated at death; others that men then
lost their personality and were absorbed into the deity; and
others that the spirit was released by death and then entered on
a separate existence, possessed of personality and capable of
enjoyment; but of the Christian doctrine of resurrection-life for
soul and body in abiding reunion they were altogether ignorant.
Those consolations which Christianity brings to the mourner were
unknown. There is an interesting letter extant which was written
to Cicero, the Roman orator, by a friend who sought to comfort
him after the death of his daughter Julia, in which the
consolation tendered strikingly marks the distinction between
Pagan and Christian views regarding death. Cicero was reminded by
his friend that even solid and substantial cities, such as those
whose ruined remains were to be seen in Asia Minor, were doomed
to decay and destruction; and if so, it could not be thought that
man's frail body can escape a similar experience. This is poor
comfort in comparison with the hope of glory which sustains the
Christian under trial. He knows not only that his soul shall live
for ever, but that the life of eternity is one in which the body
too, then incapable of pain, weariness, or death, shall have
part. "We know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were
dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with
hands, eternal in the heavens."<a name="FNanchor238"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_238"><sup>[238]</sup></a></p>
<p>Everlasting existence after resurrection will be the portion
of the righteous and the wicked. Attempts have been made to
explain away various emphatic Scripture statements regarding the
doom of the ungodly, with the view of lessening its terrors; but,
if we are to accept the plain meaning of these statements, there
seems to be no reasonable interpretation of them which gives
sanction to the belief that this doom can be escaped.</p>
<p>What is called the doctrine of Conditional Immortality finds
not a few advocates and adherents, who hold that existence in the
future state is exclusively for the faithful, and that the
sentence to be executed upon the wicked at death or at judgment
is annihilation. A different belief, termed "The Larger Hope," is
maintained by others, who affirm that the punishment to which
those dying impenitent are to be subjected will in time work
reformation and cleansing, after which, restored to God's favour,
they will enter upon a life of happiness.</p>
<p>It is a strong argument against such doctrines that the same
word which our Lord employs to describe the permanent blessedness
of the redeemed is used by Him to denote the punishment of the
wicked. The reward and the punishment are both declared by Him to
be everlasting or eternal. The same Greek word is in the English
New Testament sometimes rendered eternal and sometimes
everlasting. The portion of the righteous will be life&mdash;life
everlasting; that of the wicked is described as consisting, not
in annihilation or in terminable suffering, but in "everlasting
destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of
his power."<a name="FNanchor239"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_239"><sup>[239]</sup></a></p>
<p>While this article may be regarded as bearing upon the doom of
the ungodly, it is rather to be viewed as affirming the eternal
blessedness of the risen saints. The everlasting life begins on
earth, but is perfected only in eternity. It is sometimes spoken
of as a present possession: "He that heareth my word, and
believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall
not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto
life."<a name="FNanchor240"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_240"><sup>[240]</sup></a> Again it is spoken of as a
reward in futurity: "He shall receive an hundredfold now in this
time ... and in the world to come eternal life."<a name=
"FNanchor241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241"><sup>[241]</sup></a>
Our knowledge of what that life will be is very limited. Human
words cannot describe it; human beings in this life cannot
understand it. We know that it will arise from knowledge of God.
Men will be equal to the angels who see God. "Now we see through
a glass darkly,"<a name="FNanchor242"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_242"><sup>[242]</sup></a> but "we know that, when he
shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he
is."<a name="FNanchor243"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_243"><sup>[243]</sup></a></p>
<p>Statements regarding the happiness of the saints are in
Scripture expressed sometimes in negative and sometimes in
positive terms. In the new heavens and the new earth the redeemed
"shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more";<a name=
"FNanchor244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244"><sup>[244]</sup></a>
"There shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither
light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light."<a name=
"FNanchor245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245"><sup>[245]</sup></a>
Pain and sorrow and death can never touch them; they shall be
delivered from perplexing doubts, from all misery and trouble.
Care and anxiety shall be banished for ever, and God will wipe
away all tears from every eye.</p>
<p>There are also many positive statements regarding the future
life. Not only will there be the absence of all that is painful
and productive of sorrow; those for whom it is prepared shall
enter into rest. They shall possess abiding peace, and the joy of
their Lord will become their own. Their bodies shall be like
Christ's own glorious body, which, when transfigured on Tabor,
shone as the sun, and was white as the light. They shall be
satisfied, when they awake, with the Divine likeness.<a name=
"FNanchor246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246"><sup>[246]</sup></a>
"They shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and as the
stars for ever and ever."<a name="FNanchor247"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_247"><sup>[247]</sup></a> They shall sit down with
Christ upon His throne, and shall be rulers over cities. "They
are as the angels of God in heaven."<a name="FNanchor248"></a><a
href="#Footnote_248"><sup>[248]</sup></a> In the many mansions of
the Father's house there will be a place for every saint. Each
will be rewarded according to his works. Some are to be raised to
higher glory than others&mdash;some are to have authority over
ten cities, and some are to bear rule over five&mdash;but all the
saints will be happy in the eternal enjoyment of God's favour,
which is life; and of His loving kindness, which is better than
life.</p>

Tertullian inserts it. Neither Creed contains the first part of

<div class="note">Gen. i. 26; iii. 22; xi. 7. Different views
have been taken of these passages. Some commentators think the
plural forms represent the plural of majesty. There is, however,
no indication in the Old Testament or in ancient monumental
inscriptions that sovereigns had adopted this style of speech.
Nebuchadnezzar and Darius begin their proclamations with the
singular first personal pronoun "I"; not with the plural "We"
which modern kings assume. On the Moabite stone Mesha uses "I,"
not "We," throughout the inscription in which he records his
achievements. Another view is that Moses, accustomed to hear of
the numerous gods of Egypt, used the plural inadvertently. This
supposition does not accord with any view of inspiration held by
evangelical churches. The interpretation which regards the
passages as early indications of the doctrine of the Trinity is
simple and natural, and accords with the principle of gradual
revelation which is apparent in Scripture.</div>

<div class="note">Jesus appears to have shown Himself during the
forty days after His Resurrection at least ten times,
viz.&mdash;<br>
<br>
 1. To Mary Magdalene, Mark xvi. 9; John xx. 11-18.<br>
<br>
 2. To two disciples, Mark xvi. 12; Luke xxiv. 13-32.<br>
<br>
3. To Peter on same day, Luke xxiv. 34; Cor. xv. 5.<br>
<br>
 4. To ten Apostles, Thomas only being absent, John xx.
19-25.<br>
<br>
5. To all the Apostles, Mark xvi.14; John xx. 26-29; 1 Cor. xv.
7.<br>
<br>
6. To the women at the sepulchre, Matt, xxviii. 9, 10.<br>
<br>
7. To the Apostles, and at this time probably to five hundred
others, on a mountain in Galilee, Matt, xxviii. 16-20; 1 Cor. xv.
6.<br>
<br>
8. To seven disciples at Tiberias, John xxi. 1-24.<br>
<br>
9. To James, 1 Cor. xv. 7.<br>
<br>
10. To the Apostles at His Ascension, Mark xvi. 15-18: Luke xxiv.
44-50; Acts i. 4-8; 1 Cor. xv. 7.<br>
<br>
 These seem to be all the appearances recorded, but there were
probably many others, Acts i. 3.<br>

After His Ascension He appeared to Saul of Tarsus, Acts ix. 3-18;
1 Cor. xv. 8.<br>
<br>
He was seen by Stephen also, Acts vii. 55, 56.</div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
